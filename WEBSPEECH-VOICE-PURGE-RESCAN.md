# WebSpeech Voice System - Purge & Immediate Rescan Implementation

## Overview
Fixed the voice duplication issue by implementing a **purge-and-reload** strategy for voice syncing:
- **App Startup**: Syncs voices once (purges old, loads new, assigns numeric IDs 1, 2, 3...)
- **Rescan Button**: Immediately refetches voices, purges old ones, and refreshes the UI with a loading spinner

## Problem Solved
Previously:
- Numeric IDs kept incrementing on rescan (1,2,3 ‚Üí 4,5,6 ‚Üí 7,8,9...)
- Caused duplicate voice entries and broken numeric ID mappings
- User had to restart app to see fresh voices

Now:
- Each sync purges all voices for that provider first (clean slate)
- Numeric IDs always start fresh (1, 2, 3...)
- Rescan button provides immediate feedback with spinner

## Database Changes
Added `tts_provider_status` table to track sync state:
```sql
CREATE TABLE tts_provider_status (
  provider TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  is_enabled INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  last_synced_at TEXT,
  voice_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TEXT,
  updated_at TEXT
)
```

## Backend Changes

### VoicesRepository (`src/backend/database/repositories/voices.ts`)
- **`purgeProvider(provider)`** - Deletes all voices and numeric IDs for a provider
- **`assignNumericIds(provider)`** - Assigns sequential numeric IDs (1, 2, 3...) to all voices
- Removed old methods: `reassignNumericIds()`, `deleteVoicesNotInList()`, `markProviderAvailable()`, `markProviderUnavailable()`

### VoiceSyncService (`src/backend/services/tts/voice-sync.ts`)
- **`syncWebSpeechVoices()`** - Purges ‚Üí Inserts ‚Üí Assigns numeric IDs
- **`syncAzureVoices()`** - Same purge-then-sync pattern
- **`rescanProviderImmediate(provider, voices)`** - New method for immediate rescan from frontend
- Removed `rescanProvider()` (old next-startup approach)

### IPC Handlers (`src/backend/core/ipc-handlers.ts`)
- **`provider:rescan-immediate`** - New handler that:
  1. Takes provider + current voices from frontend
  2. Calls `rescanProviderImmediate()` on backend
  3. Returns count + updated stats
  4. UI reloads voice list immediately

## Frontend Changes

### TTS Screen (`src/frontend/screens/tts/tts.tsx`)
- **New state**: `rescanningProvider` - tracks which provider is currently rescanning
- **Updated `handleProviderRescan()`**:
  1. Gets current voices from Web Speech API
  2. Shows loading spinner (disabled button, "‚è≥ Rescanning...")
  3. Calls backend `provider:rescan-immediate` IPC handler
  4. Reloads voice list on success
  5. Shows success/error message
  6. Hides spinner

### UI Changes
- Rescan button now shows loading state:
  - Disabled during rescan
  - Shows "‚è≥ Rescanning..." text
  - Different opacity/color while loading
  - Tooltip explains what it does

## Voice Flow Now

### On App Startup
1. Check `tts_provider_status.last_synced_at` for each enabled provider
2. If `NULL`, sync is needed
3. For each provider needing sync:
   - Frontend requests Web Speech voices
   - Backend receives voices
   - Backend calls `syncWebSpeechVoices()`
   - VoiceSyncService:
     - Purges all old voices for provider
     - Inserts new voices
     - Assigns numeric IDs (1, 2, 3...)
     - Updates provider status with timestamp
   - Frontend loads voices from DB
4. Done - voices are stable until next app restart or manual rescan

### On Manual Rescan (User Clicks Button)
1. Frontend fetches current Web Speech voices
2. Shows loading spinner
3. Calls `provider:rescan-immediate` with fresh voices
4. Backend does the same sync process (purge ‚Üí insert ‚Üí assign IDs)
5. Frontend reloads voice list from DB
6. UI updates immediately (spinner hidden, success message shown)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Purge Instead of Update?
- **Before**: Tried to remap numeric IDs, kept AUTOINCREMENT IDs, caused duplicates
- **After**: Purge everything, start fresh with clean numeric sequence
- **Result**: No duplication, no ID gaps, guaranteed sequential IDs (1-N)

### Why Rescan Is Immediate Now
- **Before**: User clicked rescan ‚Üí cleared DB ‚Üí had to restart app
- **After**: User clicks rescan ‚Üí backend fetches fresh ‚Üí UI refreshes instantly
- **Result**: No app restart needed, user sees spinner for feedback

### Frontend Gets Voices, Sends to Backend
- **Why**: Web Speech API only available in renderer process
- **Benefit**: Frontend is already calling `getVoices()` anyway, just reuse that data
- **Security**: Backend still validates and stores in DB, frontend can't manipulate

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App startup with WebSpeech:
  - [ ] 0 voices initially (async load)
  - [ ] Loads N voices (11 expected on test machine)
  - [ ] DB shows exactly N voices (no duplication)
  - [ ] Numeric IDs are 1, 2, 3... N (no gaps)

- [ ] Click Rescan button:
  - [ ] Button shows "‚è≥ Rescanning..." and disables
  - [ ] Voices refresh in dropdown
  - [ ] Success message shows count
  - [ ] Button re-enables after 1-2 seconds
  - [ ] No duplicates in voice list

- [ ] Rescan multiple times:
  - [ ] Each rescan works
  - [ ] No voice duplication accumulates
  - [ ] Numeric IDs always clean (1-N)

- [ ] Voice selection works:
  - [ ] Can select voice #1, #2, etc.
  - [ ] Test voice plays with selected voice

## Logs to Look For

**Success (Startup)**:
```
[TTS] Loaded 11 voices from Web Speech API
[Voice Sync] Syncing 11 Web Speech voices
[Voices] Purged 0 webspeech voices and their numeric ID mappings
[Voices] Assigned numeric IDs for webspeech: 11 voices
[Voices] Updated provider status: webspeech (enabled=true, voices=11)
```

**Success (Rescan)**:
```
[TTS] Rescanning webspeech voices immediately...
[Voice Sync] Immediate rescan for webspeech with 11 voices
[Voice Sync] Syncing 11 Web Speech voices
[Voices] Purged 11 webspeech voices and their numeric ID mappings
[Voices] Assigned numeric IDs for webspeech: 11 voices
[Provider] Immediate rescan for webspeech...
```

**UI Feedback**:
- Rescan button shows "üîÑ Rescan" initially
- While rescanning: "‚è≥ Rescanning..." (disabled, grayed out)
- After success: "‚úì webspeech rescanned: 11 voices found" (in error/info area)
- After 2 seconds: UI resets, ready for next action
