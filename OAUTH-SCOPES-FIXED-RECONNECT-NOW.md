# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: OAuth Scopes Fixed - Re-authentication Required

## What Just Happened

I added the **missing OAuth scopes** required for moderation actions:

### üî• New Scopes Added
```typescript
'moderator:manage:banned_users',  // Required for ban/unban/timeout
'channel:manage:moderators',      // Required for add/remove moderators
```

### File Changed
- ‚úÖ `src/backend/auth/twitch-oauth.ts`

### Build Status
- ‚úÖ TypeScript: 0 errors
- ‚úÖ Webpack: Compiled successfully in 8.3s
- ‚úÖ Bundle Size: 460 KiB

---

## üö® REQUIRED NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Clear Old OAuth Session
Your current OAuth token **does NOT have these new scopes**. You MUST re-authenticate.

**In the app:**
1. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Disconnect from Twitch**
2. Or use the "Clear OAuth Cache" button if available

### Step 2: Restart the Application
The new scopes won't take effect until you reload:
```powershell
# Stop the app (Ctrl+C if running in terminal)
# Then restart:
npm start
```

### Step 3: Reconnect to Twitch
1. Click **"Connect to Twitch"**
2. **You will see a NEW authorization screen** with MORE permissions requested
3. Look for these NEW permissions in the list:
   - ‚úÖ "Manage banned and timed-out users"
   - ‚úÖ "Manage moderators"
4. Click **"Authorize"**

### Step 4: Test Moderation Actions
After re-authenticating, try the actions again:
- ‚úÖ Ban user ‚Üí Should work (was getting 401)
- ‚úÖ Timeout user ‚Üí Should work (was getting 401)
- ‚úÖ Remove moderator ‚Üí Should work (was getting 401)
- ‚úÖ Add VIP ‚Üí Will show proper error if VIP slots full (was 409)

## What Errors You Were Seeing

### Before This Fix
```
‚ùå Missing scope: moderator:manage:banned_users
‚ùå Missing scope: channel:manage:moderators
```

### After Re-authentication
```
‚úÖ Ban successful
‚úÖ Timeout successful
‚úÖ Moderator removed successfully
```

**Exception**: VIP slot limit error (409 Conflict) is CORRECT behavior:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Unable to add VIP. Visit the Achievements page on your dashboard to learn how to unlock additional VIP slots.
```
This is a Twitch limitation, not a scope issue.

## Verification Checklist

After re-authenticating, verify these work:

### ‚úÖ Should Work Now
- [ ] **Ban user** - No more 401 error
- [ ] **Timeout user** - No more 401 error
- [ ] **Unban user** - Should work
- [ ] **Add moderator** - No more 401 error
- [ ] **Remove moderator** - No more 401 error

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Errors (Not Scope Issues)
- [ ] **Add VIP** - May show 409 if VIP slots full (CORRECT)
- [ ] **Remove VIP** - Should work
- [ ] **Ban yourself** - Will show error (can't ban broadcaster)

---

## Why This Happened

The original scopes were set up for:
- ‚úÖ Reading moderation data (viewing bans, mods, VIPs)
- ‚úÖ EventSub events (listening to ban events)

But **NOT** for:
- ‚ùå **Writing** moderation actions (actually banning users)
- ‚ùå **Managing** moderators (adding/removing)

This is why you could **see** moderation status but couldn't **perform** moderation actions.

---

## Testing Script

After re-authenticating, run this test sequence:

```
1. Open Moderation Actions tab
2. Search for a test user
3. Try to timeout for 60 seconds
   - Expected: ‚úÖ Success message
   - Previous: ‚ùå 401 Unauthorized
   
4. Try to unban the user
   - Expected: ‚úÖ Success message
   - Previous: Should have worked
   
5. Try to add as moderator (if you have permissions)
   - Expected: ‚úÖ Success OR "You must be broadcaster"
   - Previous: ‚ùå 401 Unauthorized
```
