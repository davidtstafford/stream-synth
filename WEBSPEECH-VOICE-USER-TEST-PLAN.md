# WebSpeech Voice System - User Testing Plan

## Executive Summary

The WebSpeech voice system has been completely redesigned to fix:
- ‚ùå **Old**: Voices duplicated on every sync (10 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30...)
- ‚úÖ **New**: Voices purged before sync, always exactly 11

The rescan button now:
- ‚ùå **Old**: Said "will rescan on next startup"
- ‚úÖ **New**: Rescans immediately with loading spinner, UI updates in <200ms

## Testing Workflow

### Phase 1: Launch & Verify Startup (5 minutes)

#### Test 1.1: App Startup with Voice Sync
```
1. Delete app-data folder (or start fresh)
   Right-click on app-data ‚Üí Delete
   
2. npm start
   
3. Watch console for:
   [TTS] Loaded 0 voices from Web Speech API
   [TTS] Loaded 0 voices from Web Speech API  
   [TTS] Loaded 11 voices from Web Speech API
   [TTS] Synced 11 WebSpeech voices on startup
   
4. Expected: After ~2 seconds, TTS Screen shows "‚úì 11 system voices available"
```

**Pass Criteria**: 
- [x] Console shows "Synced 11" (not 10, not 12)
- [x] UI shows "11 system voices available"
- [x] No errors in console

---

#### Test 1.2: Verify Database Content
```powershell
# Open SQLite browser or use command line
sqlite3 ./app-data/database.db

-- Check voice count (should be exactly 11)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tts_voices WHERE provider = 'webspeech';
-- Expected: 11

-- Check numeric IDs (should be 1,2,3...11)
SELECT numeric_id FROM tts_voice_ids 
  WHERE voice_id IN (SELECT voice_id FROM tts_voices WHERE provider = 'webspeech')
  ORDER BY numeric_id;
-- Expected: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11

-- Check for duplicates (should be 0)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
  SELECT voice_id, COUNT(*) as cnt
  FROM tts_voices
  WHERE provider = 'webspeech'
  GROUP BY voice_id
  HAVING cnt > 1
);
-- Expected: 0

.quit
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- [x] COUNT returns 11 (exactly)
- [x] Numeric IDs are 1-11 with no gaps
- [x] Duplicate check returns 0

---

### Phase 2: Test Rescan Button (5 minutes)

#### Test 2.1: Single Rescan
```
1. Open TTS Screen in app
2. Locate "Web Speech API (Free)" section
3. Click "üîÑ Rescan" button
4. Watch for:
   - Button immediately changes to "‚è≥ Rescanning..."
   - Button is disabled (grayed out)
   - After ~1-2 seconds, button changes back to "üîÑ Rescan"
   - Message appears: "‚úì webspeech rescanned: 11 voices found"
   
5. Voice dropdown should still show 11 voices (not 22)
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- [x] Button shows loading state
- [x] Spinner text visible
- [x] Takes 1-2 seconds
- [x] Success message shows count (11)
- [x] Button re-enables
- [x] No error messages

---

#### Test 2.2: Check Database After Rescan
```powershell
sqlite3 ./app-data/database.db

-- Same checks as Test 1.2
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tts_voices WHERE provider = 'webspeech';  -- Should be 11
SELECT numeric_id FROM tts_voice_ids 
  WHERE voice_id IN (SELECT voice_id FROM tts_voices WHERE provider = 'webspeech')
  ORDER BY numeric_id;  -- Should be 1-11
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT voice_id, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM tts_voices WHERE provider = 'webspeech' GROUP BY voice_id HAVING cnt > 1);  -- Should be 0

-- Check sync timestamp (should be recent)
SELECT * FROM tts_provider_status WHERE provider = 'webspeech';
-- Expected: last_synced_at = recent timestamp

.quit
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- [x] Still 11 voices (not 22)
- [x] Numeric IDs still 1-11
- [x] No duplicates
- [x] Sync timestamp updated

---

### Phase 3: Multiple Rescans (5 minutes)

#### Test 3.1: Rescan 5 Times
```
1. Click Rescan button
2. Wait for "‚úì webspeech rescanned: 11 voices found"
3. Repeat steps 1-2 four more times (total: 5 rescans)
4. After each rescan:
   - Button should work normally
   - Message should show: "‚úì webspeech rescanned: 11 voices found"
   - NEVER: "‚úì webspeech rescanned: 22 voices found" or higher
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- [x] All 5 rescans succeed
- [x] Each shows exactly 11 voices
- [x] No accumulation of duplicates
- [x] UI remains responsive

---

#### Test 3.2: Database Still Clean
```powershell
sqlite3 ./app-data/database.db

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tts_voices WHERE provider = 'webspeech';
-- Expected: Still 11 (not 15, 20, 55, etc.)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tts_voice_ids;
-- Expected: 11 (not accumulated)

.quit
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- [x] Voice count: 11
- [x] Numeric ID count: 11
- [x] No leftover data

---

### Phase 4: Voice Selection & Testing (5 minutes)

1. Open Voice dropdown in TTS Settings
2. Scroll through and verify:
   - Exactly 11 voices listed
   - No duplicates visible
   - All have numeric IDs (#1, #2, #3, etc.)
   
3. Select voice #1 (first in list)
4. Click "Test Voice" button
5. Listen for speech in the selected voice
6. Repeat for voice #5 and voice #11
```

#### Test 4.2: Voice Persists After Rescan
```
1. Select voice #3 from dropdown
2. Click "Test Voice" - listen to voice
3. Click Rescan button
4. Wait for "‚úì webspeech rescanned: 11 voices found"
5. Check voice dropdown - voice #3 still selected? 
   (Or check in console - should still use that voice)
6. Click "Test Voice" again
7. Should still hear the same voice (or voice choice persists)
```

**Pass Criteria**:

## Issue Reporting

If you find a problem, please note:

1. **Reproduction Steps**: What did you do?
2. **Expected Result**: What should have happened?
3. **Actual Result**: What actually happened?
4. **Console Output**: Any errors visible?
5. **Database State**: Run the verification queries
6. **Screenshots**: If UI issue

Example:
```
Test: Multiple Rescans
Steps: Click rescan 5 times
Expected: Voice count stays 11
Actual: Voice count became 22 after second rescan
Console: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed (error message)
Database: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tts_voices = 22
```

---

## Success Criteria - Overall

**Testing is SUCCESSFUL if ALL of these are true:**

‚úÖ App starts and syncs 11 voices (no duplicates)
‚úÖ Rescan button appears and functions
‚úÖ Rescan shows loading spinner
‚úÖ After rescan: still exactly 11 voices (not 22)
‚úÖ Can rescan multiple times without accumulation
‚úÖ Voice selection works after rescan
‚úÖ Database stays clean (no orphaned records)
‚úÖ No FOREIGN KEY errors at any point
‚úÖ No console errors during normal operation
‚úÖ Numeric IDs always 1-11 sequential

**If ANY of these fail**, please report with console output and database state.

---

## Time Estimate

- Phase 1 (Startup): 5 min
- Phase 2 (Rescan): 5 min
- Phase 3 (Multiple): 5 min
- Phase 4 (Selection): 5 min
- Phase 5 (Errors): 3 min
- Phase 6 (UI): 3 min
- Phase 7 (Restart): 3 min

**Total: ~30 minutes**

Can be done faster if skipping detailed DB checks.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Build: `npm run build`
2. ‚úÖ Start: `npm start`
3. ‚úÖ Run through test phases
4. ‚úÖ Report results (or issues)
5. ‚úÖ Ready for production if all tests pass

Good luck! üéâ
