# Azure Setup Wizard Fixes

## Issues Reported

1. **Missing Continue Button**: After successful test connection, users couldn't proceed to the final success screen
2. **Incorrect Terminology**: Azure calls it "Speech" not "Speech Services" in the portal

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Continue Button to Test Success Screen

**Problem**: The test connection success screen showed the results but had no way to advance to the final step. The wizard auto-advanced after 1.5 seconds, but users couldn't skip the delay.

**Solution**: Added a "Continue ‚Üí" button to the test success screen that allows immediate advancement.

**Changes**:
- Added `onNext` prop to `TestConnectionStep` component
- Passed `handleNext` function from parent component
- Added green "Continue ‚Üí" button alongside "‚Üê Back" button
- Button appears after successful test with voice preview

**Code Location**: `src/frontend/components/AzureSetupWizard.tsx` lines 888-1054

### 2. Updated Terminology from "Speech Services" to "Speech"

**Problem**: Azure Portal labels the resource as "Speech" (by Microsoft), not "Speech Services". This caused confusion during setup.

**Solution**: Updated all references throughout the wizard to match Azure's actual terminology.

**Changes Made**:
- Step 2 title: "Create Speech Resource" (was "Create Speech Services Resource")
- Intro list: "Creating a Speech resource" (was "Creating a Speech Services resource")
- Instructions: Search for "Speech" and select "Speech" by Microsoft
- Get Credentials step: "In your Speech resource" (was "In your Speech Services resource")
- Loading message: "Connecting to Azure Speech..." (was "Connecting to Azure Speech Services...")
- Free tier text: "The free tier includes Speech at no cost!" (was "...includes Speech Services...")

**Files Modified**: `src/frontend/components/AzureSetupWizard.tsx`

**Lines Changed**:
- Line 245: Step header
- Line 388: Intro wizard steps list
- Line 477: Free tier description
- Line 545: Create resource intro text
- Line 557-560: Search instructions
- Line 674: Get credentials instructions
- Line 905: Loading message

‚úÖ **Build Successful**
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- Webpack: 299 KiB bundle (+1 KiB from button addition)
- Compilation time: 7287 ms

### Test Procedure

1. **Launch app**: `npm start`
2. **Enable Azure TTS** in Voice Settings
