# QUICK START - Fix Applied, Ready to Test

## What Was Fixed

✅ Chat messages now appear in Events/Chat screens  
✅ EventRouter handles all EventSub event types  
✅ IRC events no longer cause EventSub errors  
⚠️ TTS voice needs to be selected (user action)  
ℹ️ Unfollows detected via polling (Twitch limitation)

## What You Need to Do NOW

### Step 1: Restart the Application

```powershell
# If already running, close it (Ctrl+C)
# Then run:
npm run build && npm start
```

### Step 2: Select TTS Voice (IMPORTANT!)

1. Open application
2. Click **TTS Settings** in navigation
3. Under "Default Voice", select any voice (e.g., "Microsoft David Desktop")
4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test Chat Messages

1. Go to your Twitch channel
2. Type a message in chat
3. **Check the app:**
   - Events screen → Should see `channel.chat.message` event
   - Chat screen → Should see your message
   - Should hear TTS speak it (if voice selected)

### Step 4: Verify No IRC Errors

**Open DevTools Console (F12)**

**Should NOT see:**
```
❌ Create FAILED for irc.chat.join
```

**Should see:**
```
✅ Skipping IRC event irc.chat.join - handled by IRC connection
```

## Expected Behavior

### When You Send Chat Message

**Console logs:**
```
🔔 Event received (full): channel.chat.message
💬 Chat message from: YOUR_USERNAME
💾 Storing event for channel: YOUR_CHANNEL_ID
✅ Event stored with ID: XX
[EventRouter] Chat message from YOUR_USERNAME: YOUR_MESSAGE
[EventSub→TTS] Forwarding chat to TTS: YOUR_USERNAME - YOUR_MESSAGE
[TTS] Speaking: YOUR_USERNAME says: YOUR_MESSAGE
```

**In the app:**
- Events screen shows new event
- Chat screen shows message
- You hear TTS voice

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Chat messages still not appearing
**Check:** DevTools console for errors
**Solution:** Verify EventSub is connected (look for session ID in logs)

### Issue: TTS not speaking
**Check:** TTS Settings → Default Voice selected?
**Solution:** Select a voice and save

### Issue: Unfollows not showing  
**Explanation:** Twitch doesn't provide real-time unfollow events
**Solution:** Wait 2 hours OR click "Sync from Twitch" in Viewers screen
