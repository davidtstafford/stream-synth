## 🎯 The Problem (Before)

```
ONE confusing screen: "Viewer Rules"

```

TWO clear screens:

👤 Viewer Voice Settings (CUSTOMIZATION)
├─ Voice selection
├─ Pitch & speed adjustment
├─ Save/update/delete
└─ Question: "How should @Bob sound?"

🔇 Viewer TTS Restrictions (MODERATION)
├─ Add mutes/cooldowns
├─ Monitor all active restrictions
├─ Countdown timers
├─ Chat command integration
└─ Question: "Who is currently muted?"
```
