## 📊 Implementation Details

### User Experience Flow

```
1. User launches app
   ↓
2. App initializes EventSub in background (2s delay)
   ↓
3. WebSocket connects to Twitch EventSub
   ↓
4. User can navigate to "EventSub" menu
   ↓
5. Dashboard shows connection status (Connected, 8/8 subscriptions)
   ↓
6. When real events occur:
   - Dashboard updates in real-time
   - Viewers screen shows new followers/subscribers
   - Role changes appear immediately
   ↓
7. User can manually control:
   - Initialize EventSub (manual restart)
   - Disconnect (graceful shutdown)
   - Refresh Status (force query)
   - Auto-refresh toggle
```

### Component Architecture

```
