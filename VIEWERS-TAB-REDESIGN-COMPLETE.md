# Viewers Screen Redesign - Tab-Based Architecture

## 🎯 Objective

Redesign the Viewers screen from a cramped modal-based UI to a clean tab-based architecture similar to the TTS screen, with **moderation actions moved to a future dedicated screen**.

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Changes Made

#### 1. **New Tab Structure** ✅
Created 2 tabs (with room for 3rd moderation tab in future):
- **Viewer Details** - List view of all viewers (current table)
- **Viewer History** - Detailed timeline for selected viewer
- **Moderation Actions** - (Future) Dedicated screen for mod actions

#### 2. **Files Created** ✅

**Main Screen:**
- `src/frontend/screens/viewers/viewers.tsx` (NEW - 67 lines)
  - Tab navigation UI
  - State management for active tab and selected viewer
  - Navigation flow between tabs

**Tab Components:**
- `src/frontend/screens/viewers/tabs/ViewerDetailsTab.tsx` (NEW - 501 lines)
  - All viewer table functionality from original screen
  - Search, sync, delete actions
  - Click handler to navigate to history tab

- `src/frontend/screens/viewers/tabs/ViewerHistoryTab.tsx` (NEW - 432 lines)
  - Autocomplete search (like TTS Voice Settings)
  - Preselected viewer support (from Details click)
  - Timeline visualization
  - Current status display

#### 3. **User Experience Flow** ✅

**Flow 1: Click from Details**
```
1. User on "Viewer Details" tab
2. Click any viewer in table
3. → Auto-navigate to "Viewer History" tab
4. → History automatically loads for that viewer
```

**Flow 2: Direct History Search**
```
1. User clicks "Viewer History" tab
2. Type in search box (autocomplete appears)
3. Select viewer from dropdown
4. → History loads for selected viewer
```

#### 4. **Key Features** ✅

**Autocomplete Search (ViewerHistoryTab)**
- Type-ahead search (300ms debounce)
- Shows up to 10 matching viewers
- Displays name + ID
- Click to select and load history
- Click outside to close dropdown

**Timeline Display**
- Vertical timeline with connecting line
- Color-coded event dots:
  - 🔴 Red = Moderation events
  - 🟢 Green = Role changes
  - 🟣 Purple = Follow/unfollow events
- Event cards with timestamp and details
- Current status summary panel

**Current Status Panel**
- Moderation status (banned/timeout/active)
- Follower status
- Roles (Mod/VIP badges)
- Subscription tier

## 📁 File Structure

```
src/frontend/screens/viewers/
├── viewers.tsx (Main screen with tabs)
├── tabs/
│   ├── ViewerDetailsTab.tsx (Table view)
│   └── ViewerHistoryTab.tsx (Timeline view)
└── viewer-detail-modal.tsx (Can be removed later)
```

## 🎨 UI Consistency

**Tab Buttons (matches TTS style)**
- Active tab: Purple background (#9147ff) + bottom border
- Inactive tab: Transparent + gray text (#888)
- Smooth transition animation (0.2s)

**Search Autocomplete (matches TTS Voice Settings)**
- Dropdown appears below input
- Max height 300px with scroll
- Hover highlight effect
- Clean typography and spacing

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
type TabType = 'details' | 'history';
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<TabType>('details');
const [selectedViewerId, setSelectedViewerId] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
```

### Navigation Flow
```typescript
const handleViewerClick = (viewer: db.ViewerWithSubscription) => {
  setSelectedViewerId(viewer.id);  // Store viewer ID
  setActiveTab('history');          // Switch to history tab
};
```

### Autocomplete Search
```typescript
// Debounced search (300ms)
useEffect(() => {
  const searchViewers = async () => {
    if (searchQuery.trim().length < 2) return;
    const result = await db.searchViewersWithStatus(searchQuery, 10);
    setSearchResults(result.viewers);
  };
  const debounce = setTimeout(searchViewers, 300);
  return () => clearTimeout(debounce);
}, [searchQuery]);
```

## 🚀 Benefits

### 1. **Better Organization** ✅
- Separates viewing data from actions
- Each tab has a single, focused purpose
- Room for future expansion

### 2. **Improved UX** ✅
- No more cramped modals
- Full-screen real estate for timeline
- Familiar pattern (matches TTS tabs)

### 3. **Safety** ✅
- Moderation actions removed (prevents accidental clicks)
- Can be added to dedicated screen with proper confirmations

### 4. **Scalability** ✅
- Easy to add 3rd tab for moderation
- Can add bulk operations
- Room for filtering, sorting, etc.

## 🎯 Future: Moderation Actions Tab

### Proposed Design
```
Tab 3: "Moderation Actions"
├── Viewer search (autocomplete)
├── Current viewer info panel
├── Action buttons
│   ├── Ban
│   ├── Timeout (with duration)
│   ├── Add/Remove VIP
│   └── Add/Remove Moderator
├── Confirmation dialogs
└── Action history (this session)
```

### Benefits of Separate Tab
- **Intentional Navigation**: User must actively go to moderation tab
- **Clear Purpose**: No confusion about read vs. write operations
- **Better Confirmations**: Room for proper warning dialogs
- **Audit Trail**: Can show recent actions taken
- **Bulk Actions**: Future support for batch operations

## ✅ Build Status

```
✅ TypeScript: 0 errors
✅ Webpack: Success (445 KiB)

✅ Ready to test
```

## 📊 Code Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files Created | 3 |

## 🎓 Architecture Decision: Why Remove Moderation Actions?

### Problem with Original Design
```
❌ Single Modal
├── Viewer info (read)
├── History timeline (read)  
└── Moderation actions (write) ← Mixed concerns!
```

### New Architecture
```
✅ Tab 1: Details (read)
✅ Tab 2: History (read)
✅ Tab 3: Moderation (write) ← Separated!
```

### Advantages
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Read operations separate from write
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Each screen has one purpose
3. **Safety**: Harder to accidentally perform moderation actions
4. **Flexibility**: Can add features without cluttering UI
5. **Consistent UX**: Matches industry standard patterns

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Build successful
2. ⏳ Test both tabs
3. ⏳ Verify navigation flow
4. ⏳ Test with actual viewer data

### Future (Phase 8?)
1. ⏳ Create Moderation Actions tab
2. ⏳ Add bulk moderation features
3. ⏳ Add filtering and sorting to Details
4. ⏳ Add timeline filtering to History
5. ⏳ Remove old viewer-detail-modal.tsx

## 🎉 Summary

Successfully transformed the Viewers screen from a **modal-based cramped UI** into a **clean tab-based architecture** that:
- Provides better organization and navigation
- Matches the familiar TTS screen pattern
- Separates viewing data from actions
- Leaves room for future moderation features
- Improves overall user experience

**Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for testing!
