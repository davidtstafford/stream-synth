# üîß CRITICAL FIX: EventSub WebSocket Endpoint Updated

## The REAL Problem

The EventSub WebSocket connection was **failing entirely** because you were using the **deprecated BETA endpoint**:

```
‚ùå OLD (Beta - Deprecated):
wss://eventsub-beta.wss.twitch.tv

‚úÖ NEW (Production - Current):
wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws
```

---

## Error You Were Seeing

```
[EventSub] Connecting to wss://eventsub-beta.wss.twitch.tv
[EventSub] WebSocket error: ErrorEvent
[EventSub] Initialization failed: ErrorEvent
```

**This means:**
- ‚ùå WebSocket never connected
- ‚ùå No session ID was established
- ‚ùå No subscriptions could be created
- ‚ùå No events could be received

The beta endpoint has been **shut down by Twitch** and moved to production.

---

## What Was Fixed

**File:** `src/backend/services/eventsub-manager.ts` (Line 98)

### Before
```typescript
const wsUrl = 'wss://eventsub-beta.wss.twitch.tv';  // ‚ùå BETA - DEPRECATED
```

### After
```typescript
const wsUrl = 'wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws';    // ‚úÖ PRODUCTION - CURRENT
```

---

## Why This Happened

Twitch originally launched EventSub WebSockets on a beta endpoint during testing. They have since:

1. **Moved to production endpoint** (`wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws`)
2. **Deprecated the beta endpoint** (no longer accepts connections)
3. **Updated documentation** to reflect production URL

Your app was built when beta was still active, but Twitch has since migrated everyone to production.

---

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Stop the App
Close Stream Synth completely

### Step 2: Restart with New Build
The fix has been built successfully. Just launch the app again.

### Step 3: Watch for Success
You should now see:

```
‚úÖ SUCCESS:
[EventSub] Connecting to wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws
[EventSub] WebSocket connected
[EventSub] Session welcome received, session_id: AQo...
[EventSub] Session established
[EventSub] Subscribing to 15 enabled events...
[EventSub] Creating subscription attempt 1/3 for channel.ban
[EventSub] Subscription created: { data: [...] }  ‚Üê SUCCESS!
```

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### 1. WebSocket Connection Success
```
[EventSub] Connecting to wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws
[EventSub] WebSocket connected
[EventSub] Session welcome received, session_id: AQoGX...
[EventSub] Session established
```

### 2. Subscriptions Created
```
[EventSub] Creating subscription attempt 1/3 for channel.ban
[EventSub] Subscription created: {
  data: [{
    id: "abc123...",
    type: "channel.ban",
    condition: {
      broadcaster_user_id: "131323084",
      moderator_user_id: "131323084"
    },
    transport: {
      method: "websocket",
      session_id: "AQo..."
    }
  }]
}
```

### 3. Events Received
```
[Connection] EventSub notification received: channel.ban
[EventSubIntegration] ‚ö° RECEIVED EVENT FROM FRONTEND: channel.ban
[EventRouter] Processing ban event: username
[EventRouter] ‚úì Ban event recorded
```

---

## Before vs After

### BEFORE (Beta Endpoint - Broken)
```
[EventSub] Connecting to wss://eventsub-beta.wss.twitch.tv
[EventSub] WebSocket error: ErrorEvent              ‚Üê Connection failed
[EventSub] Initialization failed: ErrorEvent         ‚Üê Can't subscribe
[EventSub] All attempts failed for channel.ban       ‚Üê No connection = no subs
```

### AFTER (Production Endpoint - Working)
```
[EventSub] Connecting to wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws
[EventSub] WebSocket connected                       ‚Üê Connection success
[EventSub] Session welcome received                  ‚Üê Session established
[EventSub] Subscription created                      ‚Üê Subscriptions work
[Connection] EventSub notification received          ‚Üê Events flow
```

## Two Fixes Combined

This session actually fixed **TWO critical issues**:

### Fix #1: Ban/Unban Subscription Condition ‚úÖ
- **Problem:** Missing `moderator_user_id` in condition
- **File:** `src/frontend/services/twitch-api.ts`
- **Solution:** Added explicit handling for `channel.ban` and `channel.unban`

### Fix #2: WebSocket Endpoint (THIS FIX) ‚úÖ
- **Problem:** Using deprecated beta endpoint
- **File:** `src/backend/services/eventsub-manager.ts`
- **Solution:** Updated to production endpoint `wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws`

**Both fixes are required for EventSub to work!**

## Verification Checklist

After restarting the app:

- [ ] Console shows: `Connecting to wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws`
- [ ] Console shows: `WebSocket connected`
- [ ] Console shows: `Session welcome received`
- [ ] Console shows: `Subscription created` for channel.ban
- [ ] Console shows: `Subscription created` for channel.unban
- [ ] Connection screen shows "Connected" status
- [ ] Event Subscriptions list shows enabled events
- [ ] Test ban user ‚Üí Event received
- [ ] Viewers screen shows BANNED badge

## Twitch EventSub Documentation

**Official Production Endpoint:**
- URL: `wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws`
- Docs: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/handling-websocket-events/

**Beta Endpoint (Deprecated):**
- URL: `wss://eventsub-beta.wss.twitch.tv` ‚ùå
- Status: **No longer accepts connections**
- Migration: **Required for all apps**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Still getting WebSocket error after restart"

**Check:**
1. Did you fully close and reopen the app?
2. Are you connected to the internet?
3. Is Twitch API accessible? (Try https://api.twitch.tv/helix/users in browser)

**Try:**
1. Clear EventSub settings:
   ```javascript
   // In DevTools Console
   const { ipcRenderer } = window.require('electron');
   const settings = await ipcRenderer.invoke('db:get-all-settings');
   console.log(settings.data.filter(s => s.key.includes('eventsub')));
   ```

2. Restart app with clean slate

### "WebSocket connects but subscriptions still fail"

This means:
- ‚úÖ WebSocket endpoint fix working
- ‚ùå Subscription condition issue (Fix #1)

**Solution:** Verify both fixes are in the build:
1. Check `eventsub-manager.ts` has production URL
2. Check `twitch-api.ts` has ban/unban condition fix

---

## Summary

**Root Cause:** Using deprecated Twitch EventSub beta WebSocket endpoint  
**Impact:** EventSub completely non-functional (no connection possible)  
**Fix:** Updated to production endpoint `wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws`  
**Build:** ‚úÖ SUCCESS  
**Status:** Ready for testing  
**Action:** Restart the app  

---

## Next Steps

1. **Restart app** with new build
2. **Connect to Twitch**
3. **Verify WebSocket connection** in console
4. **Check Event Subscriptions** list shows all events enabled
5. **Test ban/unban** to verify end-to-end functionality

---

**The fix is ready! Just restart and you should be connected.** üöÄ
