# üöÄ RESTART REQUIRED - EventSub Ban/Unban Fix

## The Fix is Ready - You Need to Restart

The code fix for `channel.ban` and `channel.unban` subscriptions is complete and built successfully, but **you're still running the old version of the app**.

---

## Why You're Still Seeing Errors

```
[EventSub] All attempts to create subscription failed for channel.ban
[EventSub] All attempts to create subscription failed for channel.unban
```

These errors are happening because:
- ‚úÖ The fix IS in the code (verified in `twitch-api.ts` lines 46-50)
- ‚úÖ The build was successful
- ‚ùå **The app is still running the OLD version from before the fix**

---

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Close the App
1. **Close the Stream Synth application completely**
2. Make sure it's not running in the background (check system tray)

### Step 2: Start Fresh
1. **Launch the app again**
2. The new build with the fix will load

### Step 3: Verify Fix Applied
When you connect to Twitch, you should see:

```
[EventSub] Creating subscription attempt 1/3 for channel.ban
[EventSub] Subscription created: { data: [ { ... } ] }  ‚Üê SUCCESS!
[EventSub] Persisted subscription id (redacted)

[EventSub] Creating subscription attempt 1/3 for channel.unban
[EventSub] Subscription created: { data: [ { ... } ] }  ‚Üê SUCCESS!
[EventSub] Persisted subscription id (redacted)
```

---

## What Changed

### Before (Old Code)
```typescript
} else if (eventType.includes('moderator') || eventType.includes('shield_mode')) {
  condition.broadcaster_user_id = broadcasterId;
  condition.moderator_user_id = userId;
} else {
  condition.broadcaster_user_id = broadcasterId; // ‚ùå ban/unban fell here
}
```

**Result:** `channel.ban` and `channel.unban` only got `broadcaster_user_id` ‚Üí ‚ùå Subscription failed

### After (New Code - Already Built)
```typescript
} else if (eventType.includes('moderator') || eventType.includes('shield_mode')) {
  condition.broadcaster_user_id = broadcasterId;
  condition.moderator_user_id = userId;
} else if (eventType === 'channel.ban' || eventType === 'channel.unban') {
  // ‚úÖ Ban/unban events require moderator_user_id
  condition.broadcaster_user_id = broadcasterId;
  condition.moderator_user_id = userId;
} else {
  condition.broadcaster_user_id = broadcasterId;
}
```

**Result:** `channel.ban` and `channel.unban` get BOTH `broadcaster_user_id` AND `moderator_user_id` ‚Üí ‚úÖ Subscription succeeds

## Quick Restart Checklist

- [ ] Close Stream Synth application
- [ ] Verify it's not in system tray
- [ ] Launch Stream Synth again
- [ ] Navigate to Connection screen
- [ ] Click "Connect to Twitch"
- [ ] Watch console for success messages
- [ ] Verify subscriptions in "Event Subscriptions" section

---

## Expected Console Output (After Restart)

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS - What You Should See:

```
[EventSub] Creating subscription attempt 1/3 for channel.ban
[EventSub] Subscription created: {
  data: [{
    id: "abc123...",
    type: "channel.ban",
    version: "1",
    condition: {
      broadcaster_user_id: "123456",
      moderator_user_id: "123456"  ‚Üê This is the key!
    },
    transport: { method: "websocket", session_id: "..." },
    created_at: "2025-10-31T..."
  }]
}
```

### ‚ùå OLD ERROR - What You're Currently Seeing:

```
[EventSub] Creating subscription attempt 1/3 for channel.ban
[EventSub] Create failed status= 400 body= { error: "...", message: "..." }
[EventSub] Creating subscription attempt 2/3 for channel.ban
[EventSub] Create failed status= 400 body= { error: "...", message: "..." }
[EventSub] Creating subscription attempt 3/3 for channel.ban
[EventSub] All attempts to create subscription failed for channel.ban
```

---

## Verification After Restart

### 1. Check Event Subscriptions List
**Connection Screen ‚Üí Scroll down to "Event Subscriptions"**

Should show:
```
‚úì channel.ban - Enabled
‚úì channel.unban - Enabled
‚úì channel.moderator.add - Enabled
‚úì channel.moderator.remove - Enabled
‚úì channel.vip.add - Enabled
‚úì channel.vip.remove - Enabled
```

### 2. Test Ban Event
In Twitch chat:
```
/ban testuser spam
```

Expected result:
- Console: `[Connection] EventSub notification received: channel.ban`
- Viewers screen: Red "BANNED" badge appears
- Console: `[Viewers] Moderation changed event received`

### 3. Test Unban Event
In Twitch chat:
```
/unban testuser
```

Expected result:
- Console: `[Connection] EventSub notification received: channel.unban`
- Viewers screen: Badge disappears
- Console: `[Viewers] Moderation changed event received`

## Troubleshooting

### "Still getting subscription errors after restart"

**Check:**
1. Did you fully close the app, or just minimize it?
2. Is the app loading from `dist/frontend/app.js`? (The new build)
3. Are you signed into Twitch with moderator/broadcaster account?

**Try:**
1. Close app
2. Delete old EventSub subscription IDs:
   - DevTools Console: 
   ```javascript
   const { ipcRenderer } = window.require('electron');
   await ipcRenderer.invoke('db:set-setting', { key: 'eventsub:YOUR_CHANNEL_ID:channel.ban:subscription_id', value: '' });
   await ipcRenderer.invoke('db:set-setting', { key: 'eventsub:YOUR_CHANNEL_ID:channel.unban:subscription_id', value: '' });
   ```
3. Restart app
4. Reconnect to Twitch

### "How do I know if I'm running the new build?"

**Check the file modification time:**
```powershell
Get-Item "c:\git\staffy\stream-synth\dist\frontend\app.js" | Select-Object LastWriteTime
```

Should show a recent timestamp (within last few minutes).

### "Console shows success but events not working"

**This is a DIFFERENT issue (not the subscription problem):**
- Subscriptions are working ‚úÖ
- Event routing might have an issue
- Check backend logs for event processing
- See `EVENTSUB-REAL-TIME-COMPLETE-GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting

---

## Summary

**Status:** Fix is ready, build is complete, just need to restart app  
**Action Required:** Close and relaunch the application  
**Expected Outcome:** `channel.ban` and `channel.unban` subscriptions will succeed  
**Time to Fix:** < 30 seconds (app restart)  

---

## After Successful Restart

Once subscriptions succeed, the complete moderation tracking system will be active:

1. **Real-time ban tracking** ‚úÖ
2. **Real-time unban tracking** ‚úÖ
3. **Red "BANNED" badges in Viewers screen** ‚úÖ
4. **Orange "TIMED OUT" badges** ‚úÖ
