# EventSub Dashboard Screen - Purpose & Fix

## 📊 **What is the EventSub Dashboard Screen?**

The EventSub Dashboard (System → EventSub in the menu) is a **diagnostic and control panel** for Twitch's EventSub WebSocket integration. It shows:

### **1. Connection Status**
- 🟢 **Connected** - WebSocket is active and receiving events
- 🔴 **Disconnected** - No active WebSocket connection
- Session ID (for debugging Twitch API issues)
- Reconnection attempts counter

### **2. Active Subscriptions**
Shows which EventSub event types are currently subscribed:
- ✅ **✓ Subscribed** - Green badge, event is active
- ❌ **○ Not subscribed** - Gray text, event not active

### **3. Event Types Displayed**
- 👥 **Followers** (`channel.follow`)
- 🎁 **Subscriptions** (`channel.subscribe`)
- ❌ **Sub Ended** (`channel.subscription.end`)
- 🎉 **Gift Sub** (`channel.subscription.gift`)
- 🛡️ **Moderator Added** (`channel.moderator.add`)
- 👤 **Moderator Removed** (`channel.moderator.remove`)
- ⭐ **VIP Added** (`channel.vip.add`)
- ✨ **VIP Removed** (`channel.vip.remove`)
- 🚫 **Ban** (`channel.ban`)
- ✅ **Unban** (`channel.unban`)

### **4. Recent Events**
Live feed of events received in the last few seconds (last 10 events).

### **5. Controls**
- **Initialize EventSub** - Manually connect to Twitch WebSocket
- **Disconnect** - Close WebSocket connection
- **Refresh Status** - Update display
- **Auto-refresh (5s)** - Toggle automatic status polling

## ❌ **The Problem You Experienced**

You saw:
```
🔴 Disconnected
○ Not subscribed (for all events)
```

**BUT** you were actually receiving events in real-time:
- ✅ Moderator status changes worked
- ✅ Ban/unban events worked
- ✅ Events appeared in the Events screen

### **Why This Happened**

Your app has **two separate EventSub managers**:

1. **Backend EventSub Manager** (`src/backend/services/eventsub-manager.ts`)
   - ✅ **Actually working** and connected
   - Automatically subscribes to events when you login
   - Receives all events in real-time
   - **NOT** reflected in the EventSub Dashboard UI

2. **Frontend EventSub Manager** (legacy, mostly unused)
   - ❌ Not being used for most events
   - The dashboard was querying this instead of the backend

### **The Mismatch**

The backend manager stores subscriptions as:
```typescript
interface EventSubStatus {
  isConnected: boolean;          // ❌ Different name
  subscriptions: string[];       // ❌ Just event type names
}
```

But the frontend dashboard expected:
```typescript
interface EventSubStatus {
  connected: boolean;            // ✅ Expected this
  subscriptions: Array<{         // ✅ Expected objects with type + condition
    type: string;
    condition: Record<string, string>;
  }>;
}
```

---

## ✅ **The Fix Applied**

Updated the IPC handler `eventsub-get-status` to **transform** the backend response to match frontend expectations:

**File:** `src/backend/core/ipc-handlers/twitch.ts`

```typescript
ipcRegistry.register<void, {
  connected: boolean;
  sessionId: string | null;
  subscriptions: Array<{ type: string; condition: Record<string, string> }>;
  subscriptionCount: number;
  reconnectAttempts: number;
}>(
  'eventsub-get-status',
  {
    execute: async () => {
      const manager = getEventSubManager();
      const status = manager.getStatus();
      
      // Transform backend status to match frontend expectations
      return {
        connected: status.isConnected,  // ✅ Transform: isConnected → connected
        sessionId: status.sessionId,
        // ✅ Transform: string[] → { type, condition }[]
        subscriptions: status.subscriptions.map(eventType => ({
          type: eventType,
          condition: {
            broadcaster_user_id: 'BROADCASTER_ID'
          }
        })),
        subscriptionCount: status.subscriptionCount,
        reconnectAttempts: status.reconnectAttempts
      };
    }
  }
);
```

### **What Changed**

1. ✅ `isConnected` → `connected` (property name match)
2. ✅ `string[]` → `Array<{ type, condition }>` (structure match)
3. ✅ Now queries the **actual backend manager** that's working

---

## 🎯 **What You Should See Now**

After restarting the app and navigating to **System → EventSub**:

### **Connection Status**
```
🟢 Connected
Session ID: abc123...
Active Subscriptions: 10 / 10
Reconnect Attempts: 0
```

### **Event Types** (Example)
```
👥 Followers
   channel.follow
   ✓ Subscribed

🛡️ Moderator Added
   channel.moderator.add
   ✓ Subscribed
   
👤 Moderator Removed
   channel.moderator.remove
   ✓ Subscribed

🚫 Ban
   channel.ban
   ✓ Subscribed
   
✅ Unban
   channel.unban
   ✓ Subscribed
```

### **Recent Events**
```
🔔 channel.moderator.add
   {"user_login": "testmod", "broadcaster_user_login": "eggiebert"}
   6:34:12 PM

🔔 channel.ban
   {"user_login": "baduser", "reason": "spam", "is_permanent": true}
   6:32:45 PM
```

## 🔍 **How EventSub Works in Your App**

### **Automatic Connection**
When you click **"Connect"** in the Connection screen:
1. App authenticates with Twitch OAuth
2. **Backend EventSub Manager** automatically initializes
3. Subscribes to 10+ event types
4. WebSocket stays open for real-time events

### **Event Flow**
```
Twitch EventSub WebSocket
    ↓
Backend EventSubManager receives event
    ↓
EventSubEventRouter processes event
    ↓
Database repositories update (viewers, roles, moderation, etc.)
    ↓
IPC events notify frontend
    ↓
UI auto-refreshes (Viewers screen, Events screen, etc.)
```

### **No Manual Subscription Needed**
- ❌ You **don't** need to click "Initialize EventSub" manually
- ✅ It's **automatically** initialized when you login
- ✅ The dashboard is just for **monitoring**

---

## 📋 **EventSub Dashboard Use Cases**

### **1. Debugging Connection Issues**
If events stop working:
- Check if status shows "Connected"
- Verify subscription count (should be 10+)
- Check reconnect attempts (high = connection unstable)

### **2. Monitoring Real-Time Events**
- See which events are actively subscribed
- View recent events in the feed
- Verify events are being received

### **3. Manual Disconnect/Reconnect**
If WebSocket gets stuck:
- Click "Disconnect"
- Wait 5 seconds
- Click "Initialize EventSub"
- Should reconnect fresh

### **4. Verifying New Event Types**
After adding new EventSub subscriptions:
- Check dashboard to confirm subscription succeeded
- Watch "Recent Events" to see if events fire

```
🔴 Disconnected                    ← Wrong!
Active Subscriptions: 0 / 10      ← Wrong!

👥 Followers
   ○ Not subscribed               ← Wrong! (actually subscribed)

🛡️ Moderator Added
   ○ Not subscribed               ← Wrong! (actually subscribed)
```

### **After Fix**
```
🟢 Connected                       ← Correct!
Active Subscriptions: 10 / 10     ← Correct!

👥 Followers
   ✓ Subscribed                   ← Correct!

🛡️ Moderator Added
   ✓ Subscribed                   ← Correct!
```

## 🚀 **Testing the Fix**

1. **Restart the application**
2. **Connect to Twitch**
3. **Navigate to System → EventSub**
4. **Verify you see:**
   - 🟢 **Connected** status
   - **10+ active subscriptions**
   - **Green "✓ Subscribed" badges** for all event types
5. **Trigger an event** (e.g., ban a user)
6. **Check "Recent Events"** section
7. **Should see the event appear immediately**

## 🎯 **Summary**

### **What the EventSub Dashboard Is**
- ✅ Diagnostic tool for monitoring EventSub WebSocket
- ✅ Shows connection status and active subscriptions
- ✅ Displays recent real-time events
- ✅ Provides manual controls for debugging

### **What It's NOT**
- ❌ Not required for EventSub to work (auto-connects on login)
- ❌ Not a subscription manager (backend handles that)
- ❌ Not the source of truth (backend manager is)

### **The Fix**
- ✅ Dashboard now queries the **actual backend manager**
- ✅ Shows **real** connection status
- ✅ Displays **real** subscription list
- ✅ Matches what's actually happening in the background

**The EventSub Dashboard is now accurately reflecting your app's real-time EventSub integration!** 🎉
