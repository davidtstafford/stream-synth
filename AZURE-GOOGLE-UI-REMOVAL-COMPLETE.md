## Defensive Code Remaining

The following code remains for backend compatibility (won't affect users):

1. **Function signatures** (`handleProviderToggle`, `handleProviderRescan`)
   - Still accept `'azure' | 'google'` as parameters
   - But guard clauses prevent them from executing
   - Backend may still need to handle these types

2. **Voice filtering checks**
   - `voiceId.startsWith('google_')` checks prevent Google voices from appearing
   - `voiceId.startsWith('azure_')` checks prevent Azure voices from appearing
   - These are defensive and won't expose disabled providers

3. **Comments**
   - References to "Azure" and "Google" in comments for clarity
   - These don't affect the user interface

## User Experience Changes

### Before
- Users saw three provider options: WebSpeech, Azure, Google
- Azure and Google were disabled/greyed out
- Two provider sections took up space in UI

### After
- Users see only one active provider: WebSpeech
- No disabled/greyed out options in provider section
- Cleaner, simpler UI focused on available functionality
- Error messages if backend mistakenly tries to toggle Azure/Google

## Related Components

### Unchanged Files (Backend-compatible)
- `src/frontend/services/tts.ts` - Still handles Azure/Google for backend compatibility
- `src/frontend/components/AzureSetupWizard.tsx` - Component still exists but no longer imported
- Backend files - No changes needed (already had disabled Azure logic)

### Type Safety
- Function parameters still accept `'azure' | 'google'` for type safety
- Guard clauses prevent execution
- No runtime errors from type mismatches

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Start the application** and verify the TTS Settings tab loads
2. **Check Settings Tab** - Verify only WebSpeech provider option visible
3. **Check Viewers Tab** - Verify voice picker only shows WebSpeech voices
4. **Test Voice Selection** - Verify all available voices are still accessible
5. **Test Provider Toggle** - Verify WebSpeech toggle works normally
6. **Open Console** - No errors or warnings about missing Azure/Google

---

## Summary

✅ **Complete**: All Azure and Google UI elements have been successfully removed from the TTS interface while maintaining backend compatibility and type safety. The application now presents a clean, focused UI showing only the WebSpeech provider which is actively available.

**Next Steps**: Deploy and test with users to confirm the UI improvements.
