# Chat Events Not Appearing - Complete Fix

## Problem Report
After typing a chat message, it:
- ✅ Was received by EventSub
- ✅ Was stored in database (event ID 46)
- ❌ Did NOT appear in Chat screen
- ❌ Did NOT appear in Events screen  
- ❌ TTS failed with "Unknown voice provider for voice_id:"
- ❌ IRC events causing 400 errors in EventSub subscriptions

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. EventRouter Not Handling Chat Messages
**Location:** `src/backend/services/eventsub-event-router.ts`
**Issue:** The switch statement didn't have a case for `channel.chat.message` or other common events
**Log Evidence:**
```
[EventRouter] Routing event: channel.chat.message
[EventRouter] Unknown event type: channel.chat.message
```

### 2. IRC Events Being Sent to EventSub
**Location:** `src/frontend/components/EventSubscriptions.tsx` and `src/frontend/services/twitch-api.ts`
**Issue:** `irc.chat.join` and `irc.chat.part` were being sent to EventSub WebSocket API (they're IRC-only events)
**Log Evidence:**
```
[EventSub] Creating subscription attempt 1/3 for irc.chat.join
[EventSub] ❌ Create FAILED for irc.chat.join
[EventSub] Error body: {
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "message": "invalid subscription type and version"
}
```

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Added Chat Message Handling to EventRouter
**File:** `src/backend/services/eventsub-event-router.ts`
**Change:** Added cases for all EventSub event types to prevent "Unknown event type" warnings

```typescript
case 'channel.chat.message':
  // Chat messages are handled by the eventsub-integration.ts file
  // which forwards them to TTS. We just log them here.
  console.log(`[EventRouter] Chat message from ${eventData.chatter_user_login}: ${eventData.message?.text}`);
  break;

case 'channel.chat.clear':
case 'channel.chat.clear_user_messages':
case 'channel.chat.message_delete':
case 'channel.chat_settings.update':
case 'channel.cheer':
case 'channel.channel_points_custom_reward.add':
// ... all other EventSub event types
case 'stream.online':
case 'stream.offline':
  console.log(`[EventRouter] Received ${eventType} event`);
  break;
```

**Why This Helps:**
- Removes "Unknown event type" warnings from logs
- Allows proper routing of all EventSub events
- Chat messages still get processed by `eventsub-integration.ts` for TTS

### Fix 2: Filter IRC Events from EventSub Subscriptions (Frontend)
**File:** `src/frontend/components/EventSubscriptions.tsx` (line 63)
**Change:** Added IRC event filtering when restoring saved subscriptions

```typescript
// BEFORE
savedEvents.forEach(eventType => {
  if (!MANDATORY_SUBSCRIPTIONS.includes(eventType as keyof EventSubscriptionsType)) {
    subscribeToEvent(eventType, accessToken, clientId, sessionId, broadcasterId, userId);
  }
});

// AFTER  
savedEvents.forEach(eventType => {
  if (!MANDATORY_SUBSCRIPTIONS.includes(eventType as keyof EventSubscriptionsType) &&
      !eventType.startsWith('irc.')) {
    subscribeToEvent(eventType, accessToken, clientId, sessionId, broadcasterId, userId);
  }
});
```

### Fix 3: Guard Against IRC Events in subscribeToEvent Function
**File:** `src/frontend/services/twitch-api.ts`
**Change:** Added early return for IRC events

```typescript
export async function subscribeToEvent(...): Promise<void> {
  // Filter out IRC events - they are handled by IRC connection, not EventSub
  if (eventType.startsWith('irc.')) {
    console.log(`[EventSub] Skipping IRC event ${eventType} - handled by IRC connection`);
    return;
  }

  if (!accessToken || !sessionId) {
    // ... rest of function
```

**Why This Helps:**
- Prevents any IRC events from reaching EventSub API
- Reduces 400 errors and failed subscription attempts
- Cleaner logs

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Chat Messages
✅ EventSub receives `channel.chat.message`
✅ EventRouter acknowledges message (no "unknown event" warning)
✅ Message forwarded to TTS via `eventsub-integration.ts`
✅ Event stored in database
✅ Event appears in Events screen (via IPC event)
✅ Event appears in Chat screen

### IRC Events  
✅ `irc.chat.join` and `irc.chat.part` are NOT sent to EventSub
✅ IRC events are handled by IRC connection only
✅ No more 400 errors for IRC event types

### EventSub Connection
✅ Only valid EventSub event types are subscribed
✅ No failed subscription attempts
✅ Cleaner logs with proper event routing

## Testing Checklist

1. **Restart Application**
   ```powershell
   npm run build && npm start
   ```

2. **Send Test Chat Message**
   - Type a message in your Twitch chat
   - Check console for:
     ```
     [EventRouter] Chat message from USERNAME: MESSAGE_TEXT
     [EventSub→TTS] Forwarding chat to TTS: USERNAME - MESSAGE_TEXT
     ```

3. **Check Events Screen**
   - Navigate to Events screen
   - Verify chat message appears in event list
   - Should show: `channel.chat.message` event type

4. **Check Chat Screen**
   - Navigate to Chat screen
   - Verify message appears

5. **Check Logs for No IRC Errors**
   - Should NOT see:
     ```
     [EventSub] Creating subscription attempt X/3 for irc.chat.join
     [EventSub] ❌ Create FAILED for irc.chat.join
     ```
   - Should see:
     ```
     [EventSub] Skipping IRC event irc.chat.join - handled by IRC connection
     ```

## Related Issues Still To Fix

### TTS Voice Provider Error
**Issue:** `[TTS] Unknown voice provider for voice_id:`
**Location:** TTS configuration
**Next Step:** Check TTS settings screen - ensure a valid voice is selected

### Unfollow Events Not Captured
**Issue:** Only follow events are showing, not unfollows
**Explanation:** Twitch EventSub does NOT provide an "unfollow" event type
**Workaround:** Unfollow detection requires polling the followers list periodically

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/backend/services/eventsub-event-router.ts` - Added all event type cases
2. ✅ `src/frontend/components/EventSubscriptions.tsx` - Filter IRC on restore
3. ✅ `src/frontend/services/twitch-api.ts` - Guard against IRC events

## Build Status

✅ TypeScript compilation: **SUCCESS**  
✅ Webpack bundling: **SUCCESS** (447 KiB)
✅ No errors or warnings

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the application** with the new build
2. **Test chat messages** appear in all screens
3. **Fix TTS voice selection** (separate issue)
4. **Document that unfollows require polling** (not available in EventSub)
