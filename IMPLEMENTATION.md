# Stream Synth MVP - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Stream Synth is a TypeScript-based desktop application built with Electron that provides Twitch integration with OAuth authentication and WebSocket connectivity.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Project Structure ✅
- **Modular architecture** with clear separation of Frontend and Backend
- **Frontend**: `/src/frontend/` - React components and screens
- **Backend**: `/src/backend/` - Electron main process
- **Screens**: `/src/frontend/screens/connection/` - Modular screen organization

### 2. Technology Stack ✅
- **Electron 35.7.5**: Desktop application framework (security-patched version)
- **TypeScript 5.3.3**: Type-safe development
- **React 18.2.0**: UI framework
- **WebSocket (ws 8.16.0)**: Real-time communication
- **Webpack 5**: Module bundling

### 3. Core Features ✅

#### Left Navigation Menu
- Custom-built menu component (`Menu.tsx`)
- Currently shows "Connection" screen
- Easily extensible for additional screens
- Clean, modern design with Twitch purple accent color

#### Connection Screen
- **Client ID Input**: Text field for Twitch Client ID
- **Internal OAuth**: Uses Electron BrowserWindow for authentication (not external browser)
- **Status Messages**: Real-time feedback on connection status
- **Token Display**: Shows truncated access token for verification
- **WebSocket Integration**: Automatically connects to Twitch EventSub after authentication

### 4. Authentication Flow ✅
1. User enters Twitch Client ID
2. Clicks "Connect to Twitch" button
3. Internal browser window opens with Twitch OAuth
4. User authenticates on Twitch
5. Token captured via redirect URL
6. Access token returned to frontend
7. WebSocket connection established automatically

### 5. WebSocket Implementation ✅
- Connects to Twitch EventSub WebSocket (`wss://eventsub.wss.twitch.tv/ws`)
- Handles connection lifecycle (open, message, error, close)
- Displays session information when connected
- Ready for event subscriptions

### 6. Build System ✅
- **TypeScript compilation**: Backend code compiled to JavaScript
- **Webpack bundling**: Frontend React code bundled
- **HTML copying**: Static assets moved to dist folder
- **One-command build**: `npm run build` does everything

### 7. Security ✅
- Updated Electron to patched version (35.7.5)
- No security vulnerabilities detected (CodeQL analysis)
- Proper separation of main/renderer processes
- Secure OAuth flow with token handling

Total: ~470 lines of source code

## How to Use

### Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Getting Twitch Client ID
1. Visit https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
2. Register new application
3. Set OAuth Redirect URL to `http://localhost`
4. Copy Client ID and use in app

### Using the App
1. Launch application
2. Enter Twitch Client ID
3. Click "Connect to Twitch"
4. Authenticate in internal window
5. WebSocket connection established automatically

## What's Ready for Extension

### Adding New Screens
1. Create new folder in `/src/frontend/screens/`
2. Add screen component (e.g., `dashboard.tsx`)
3. Add menu item in `app.tsx`
4. Add route in `renderScreen()` function

### Adding Event Subscriptions
The WebSocket connection is ready. To add subscriptions:
1. Use the session ID from welcome message
2. Make API call to Twitch EventSub with subscription details
3. Handle events in WebSocket message handler

## Notes
- The application is fully modular and ready for expansion
- Code follows TypeScript best practices
- UI uses Twitch's purple (#9147ff) as accent color
- All authentication happens within the app (no external browser)
- WebSocket connection is established but subscriptions need to be added based on use case

## Branch Information
Note: Due to the system working with the current branch structure, the work is on the `copilot/create-connection-screen` branch. The MVP branch was created but authentication doesn't allow direct push. All code changes are identical and can be merged to MVP as needed.
