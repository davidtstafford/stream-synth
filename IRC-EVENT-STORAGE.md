# IRC Event Storage - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
- JOIN and PART events (users entering/leaving chat) were not being stored in the database
- Events screen didn't show these IRC events
- Those event types (`irc.chat.join`, `irc.chat.part`) don't exist in Twitch EventSub API - they're IRC-only

### Solution
Updated the IRC event handlers in `ipc-handlers.ts` to:
1. **Store events in database** when users join/leave chat
2. **Create/update viewer records** for IRC users
3. **Broadcast real-time updates** to the Events screen via IPC

### Files Modified

**Backend (`src/backend/core/ipc-handlers.ts`):**
- Added database storage to `twitchIRCService.on('chat.join')` handler
- Added database storage to `twitchIRCService.on('chat.part')` handler
- Both now call `viewersRepo.getOrCreate()` and `eventsRepo.storeEvent()`
- Both broadcast `event:stored` IPC message for real-time UI updates

**Frontend (`src/frontend/screens/events/events.tsx`):**
- Added visual preview for `irc.chat.join` - shows "→ Username joined the chat" in green
- Added visual preview for `irc.chat.part` - shows "← Username left the chat" in red

**Frontend (`src/frontend/screens/connection/connection.tsx`):**
- Fixed event structure extraction (was looking at wrong path)
- Changed from `data.subscription?.type` to `data.payload?.subscription?.type`
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### IRC Event Flow

```
User joins/leaves chat
       ↓
IRC Service (tmi.js) detects event
       ↓
TwitchIRCService emits 'chat.join' or 'chat.part'
       ↓
IPC Handler receives event
       ↓
1. Get current session (for channel_id)
2. Get or create viewer record
3. Store event in database
4. Log success
5. Broadcast 'event:stored' to renderer
       ↓
Events Screen receives real-time update
       ↓
Event appears immediately in UI
```

### Event Structure

**JOIN Event:**
```json
{
  "type": "irc.chat.join",
  "channel": "channelname",
  "username": "viewer_username",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T11:38:47.466Z"
}
```

**PART Event:**
```json
{
  "type": "irc.chat.part",
  "channel": "channelname",
  "username": "viewer_username",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T11:38:47.466Z"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### To Test JOIN Events:
1. Restart the app (`npm start`)
2. Connect to Twitch
3. Make sure IRC is connected (check console for `[IRC] Connected to #yourchannel`)
4. **Open another browser** and visit your Twitch channel
5. The JOIN event should appear in:
   - Terminal: `[IRC] User joined: username`
   - Terminal: `[IRC] JOIN event stored with ID: X`
   - Events screen (automatically, no refresh needed)
   - Shows as: "→ username joined the chat" in green

### To Test PART Events:
1. Close the browser tab where you're viewing the channel
2. The PART event should appear in:
   - Terminal: `[IRC] User left: username`
   - Terminal: `[IRC] PART event stored with ID: X`
   - Events screen (automatically, no refresh needed)
   - Shows as: "← username left the chat" in red

### Current Console Logs

When an event is received, you'll see:
```
🔔 Event received (full): { full JSON structure }
📝 Event type: channel.chat.message (or other type)
📦 Event payload: { event data }
💬 Chat message from: username (ID: 123456)
👥 Creating/updating viewer: username
👥 Viewer result: { success: true }
💾 Storing event for channel: 131323084
💾 Store result: { success: true, id: 1 }
✅ Event stored with ID: 1
```

For IRC events:
```
[IRC] User joined: username
[IRC] JOIN event stored with ID: 2
```

## 📊 Database Storage

### Viewers Table
IRC users are stored in the `viewers` table:
- **id**: username (since IRC doesn't provide Twitch user IDs)
- **username**: IRC username
- **display_name**: Same as username (IRC doesn't distinguish)
- **created_at**: First seen timestamp
- **updated_at**: Last event timestamp

### Events Table
IRC events stored in `events` table:
- **event_type**: `irc.chat.join` or `irc.chat.part`
- **event_data**: JSON with channel, username, timestamp
- **viewer_id**: References viewer (username)
- **channel_id**: Current channel ID from session
- **created_at**: Event timestamp

## ✨ Visual Display

### Events Screen
- **JOIN**: `→ username` in **green** "joined the chat"
- **PART**: `← username` in **red** "left the chat"
- Appears in event list with timestamp
- Can click to view full event details
- Can filter by event type: `irc.chat.join` or `irc.chat.part`

### Viewers Screen
- IRC users appear alongside EventSub users
- No distinction (same table)
- Shows first seen and last updated times

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Why IRC is Needed
1. **EventSub doesn't provide JOIN/PART events** - These are IRC-exclusive
2. **EventSub error 400** when trying to subscribe to `irc.chat.join` or `irc.chat.part` - These aren't valid EventSub subscriptions
3. **IRC complements EventSub** - Use both for complete coverage:
   - EventSub: Chat messages, subs, follows, raids, cheers, etc.
   - IRC: JOIN, PART, and sending messages

### Limitations
- **No Twitch User ID for IRC JOIN/PART** - We only get the username
- **IRC users might not match EventSub users** - Same person could have different viewer records if they only join via IRC
- **High volume channels** - JOIN/PART events can be very frequent (hundreds per minute)

### Performance Considerations
- Each JOIN/PART creates a database write
- Each event broadcasts to renderer
- In high-volume channels, consider:
  - Batching events
  - Rate limiting broadcasts
  - Disabling JOIN/PART storage if not needed

## 🎉 Success Criteria

✅ IRC events are stored in database  
✅ IRC events appear in Events screen  
✅ IRC events show in real-time (no refresh)  
✅ IRC users are tracked in Viewers table  
✅ Visual distinction (green JOIN, red PART)  
✅ Console logging for debugging  
✅ Proper error handling  

## 🔄 Next Steps

If you want to test:
1. **Restart app**: `npm start`
2. **Connect to Twitch**
3. **Open your channel in another browser**
4. **Watch the Events screen** - you should see the JOIN event appear
5. **Close the browser tab** - you should see the PART event appear

The implementation is complete and ready to use! 🚀
