## 🔥 NEW FIX: Duplicate Events

### The Problem
Events were appearing **2-3 times** in the Events screen because the frontend was sending events BACK to the backend, creating a circular loop:

```
Twitch → Backend → Database → Frontend
                      ↑            ↓
                      └────────────┘ LOOP!
```

### The Solution
**Removed the circular loop:**
- Frontend no longer forwards events to backend
- Backend only processes events directly from Twitch WebSocket
- Events now stored **exactly once**

### Files Modified
- ✅ `src/frontend/screens/connection/connection.tsx` - Removed event forwarding
- ✅ `src/backend/services/eventsub-integration.ts` - Removed duplicate listener

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Test Moderation Actions (After Reconnecting)
- [ ] **Ban a user** → Should show green success toast
- [ ] **Timeout a user** → Should show green success toast
- [ ] **Add VIP** → Should show green success toast
- [ ] **Check ban status** → Should display in Moderation tab

### 2. Test Events (No Duplicates)
- [ ] **Trigger a ban** → Check Events tab → Should see **1 event** (not 2-3)
- [ ] **Trigger a chat message** → Should see **1 event**
- [ ] **Check database:**
  ```sql
  SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) 
  FROM events 
  WHERE event_type = 'channel.ban' 
  GROUP BY event_type;
  ```
  **Expected:** Count = 1 per ban ✅

### 3. Test Other Events
- [ ] Subscribe event → **1 entry** ✅
- [ ] Raid event → **1 entry** ✅
- [ ] Moderator added/removed → **1 entry** ✅

## 📚 Documentation

All fixes are documented in detail:

### Main Documentation
1. **`MODERATION-ACTIONS-ALL-FIXES-COMPLETE.md`** - Complete summary of all 5 fixes
2. **`DUPLICATE-EVENTS-FIXED.md`** - Technical explanation of circular loop fix
3. **`DUPLICATE-EVENTS-VISUAL-GUIDE.md`** - Visual before/after diagrams

### Previous Documentation
4. `OAUTH-SCOPES-FIXED-RECONNECT-NOW.md` - OAuth scope update guide
5. `IPC-RESPONSE-WRAPPING-FIX.md` - IPC double-wrapping explanation
6. `MODERATION-ACTIONS-API-FIX.md` - API body format fix

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Ban status check: "getTokens is not a function" error
- ❌ Ban user: Claims success but fails (403 Forbidden)
- ❌ Events: 2-3 duplicate entries for each event
- ❌ Database: Bloated with duplicate events
- ❌ No error messages shown to user

### After Fixes
- ✅ Ban status check: Works correctly
- ✅ Ban user: Succeeds with green toast notification
- ✅ Events: Exactly 1 entry per event
- ✅ Database: Clean, no duplicates
- ✅ Error messages: Displayed to user when actions fail

---

## 🔍 Key Changes Explained

### 1. Circular Event Loop (Eliminated)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Frontend was doing this:
ipcRenderer.send('eventsub-event-received', eventData);
// This sent events BACK to backend, creating duplicates
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Frontend just displays events now:
// Backend handles all event processing
// No more circular loop!
```

### 2. Event Flow (Now Correct)

```
Twitch WebSocket
    ↓
Backend (eventsub-manager)
    ↓
Event Router → Database (ONCE)
    ↓
Frontend (for display only)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Must Reconnect to Twitch
After restarting, you **MUST** disconnect and reconnect to Twitch to get the new OAuth scopes:
- `moderator:manage:banned_users`
- `channel:manage:moderators`

Without these, moderation actions will still fail (403 Forbidden).

### Optional: Clean Old Duplicates
If you want to remove old duplicate events from the database:
```sql
-- Backup first!
CREATE TABLE events_backup AS SELECT * FROM events;

-- Delete duplicates (keep oldest)
DELETE FROM events 
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT MIN(id) 
  FROM events 
  GROUP BY event_type, timestamp, channel_id, user_id
);
```

3. **✅ Reconnect to Twitch** (to get new scopes)
4. **✅ Test moderation actions**
5. **✅ Verify no duplicate events**
6. **✅ Check Events screen**
7. **✅ (Optional) Clean old duplicates from database**
