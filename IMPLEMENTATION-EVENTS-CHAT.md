# Events and Chat Screens Implementation - Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive event storage and display functionality to the Stream Synth application, including:
1. SQLite database tables for storing events and viewer information
2. An Events screen for viewing and filtering all events
3. A Chat screen for real-time chat display with persistence
4. Automatic event and viewer tracking from both WebSocket (EventSub) and IRC sources

## Changes Made

### Database Schema (src/backend/database/migrations.ts)
Added two new tables:

**viewers table:**
- `id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY) - Twitch user ID
- `username` (TEXT) - Twitch username (login)
- `display_name` (TEXT) - Display name
- `created_at` (DATETIME) - First seen timestamp
- `updated_at` (DATETIME) - Last updated timestamp

**events table:**
- `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
- `event_type` (TEXT) - Event type (e.g., 'channel.chat.message')
- `event_data` (TEXT) - JSON string of the event payload
- `viewer_id` (TEXT) - Foreign key to viewers table (nullable)
- `channel_id` (TEXT) - Channel where event occurred
- `created_at` (DATETIME) - Event timestamp

**Indexes:**
- `idx_events_type` - For filtering by event type
- `idx_events_channel` - For filtering by channel
- `idx_events_viewer` - For filtering by viewer
- `idx_events_created` - For sorting by date

### Backend Repositories

**ViewersRepository (src/backend/database/repositories/viewers.ts):**
- `getOrCreate(id, username, displayName)` - Get existing or create new viewer
- `getById(id)` - Get viewer by ID
- `getByUsername(username)` - Get viewer by username
- `getAll(limit, offset)` - Get all viewers with pagination
- `search(query, limit)` - Search viewers by username or display name

**EventsRepository (src/backend/database/repositories/events.ts):**
Extended with new methods:
- `storeEvent(eventType, eventData, channelId, viewerId)` - Store a new event
- `getEvents(filters)` - Get events with filters (type, date, search, pagination)
- `getChatEvents(channelId, limit)` - Get chat messages only
- `getEventById(id)` - Get single event with viewer data
- `deleteOldEvents(beforeDate)` - Cleanup old events
- `getEventCount(channelId, eventType)` - Count events

### IPC Handlers (src/backend/core/ipc-handlers.ts)
Added new IPC handlers:
- `db:store-event` - Store an event
- `db:get-events` - Get events with filters
- `db:get-chat-events` - Get chat events
- `db:get-event-count` - Get event count
- `db:get-or-create-viewer` - Get or create viewer
- `db:get-viewer` - Get viewer by ID
- `db:search-viewers` - Search viewers

Added `storeEventWithViewer()` helper function to store events with automatic viewer creation.

Updated IRC event handlers to store join/part events automatically.

### Frontend Services (src/frontend/services/database.ts)
Added new frontend API methods:
- `storeEvent()` - Store an event
- `getEvents()` - Get events with filters
- `getChatEvents()` - Get chat events
- `getEventCount()` - Get event count
- `getOrCreateViewer()` - Get or create viewer
- `getViewer()` - Get viewer by ID
- `searchViewers()` - Search viewers

### Events Screen (src/frontend/screens/events/events.tsx)
New screen with features:
- **Event Table** - Displays all events in a paginated table
- **Filters:**
  - Event type dropdown (all event types from config)
  - Free text search (searches within event data)
  - Date range (start and end date pickers)
- **Pagination** - 50 events per page with Previous/Next buttons
- **Event Preview** - Smart preview based on event type (chat, raid, subscribe, etc.)
- **Detail View** - Click any event to see full JSON data in a modal
- **Viewer Display** - Shows viewer username/display name for each event
- **Auto-refresh** - Refreshes every 10 seconds when not viewing details
- **Count Display** - Shows "X of Y events" with total count

### Chat Screen (src/frontend/screens/chat/chat.tsx)
New screen with features:
- **Real-time Chat** - Displays chat messages as they arrive
- **Persistent History** - Loads chat from database, persists when navigating away
- **Configurable Limit** - Max messages setting (50, 100, 200, 500)
  - Saved to database as `chat_max_messages` setting
- **Auto-scroll** - Automatically scrolls to newest messages
  - Can be toggled off
  - "Jump to Bottom" button appears when scrolled up
- **Message Display:**
  - Timestamp (HH:MM:SS format)
  - Username with color
  - Message text
- **Listeners** - Listens for `event:stored` IPC events for real-time updates
- **Clear Display** - Button to clear the current display (doesn't delete from DB)

### WebSocket Integration (src/frontend/screens/connection/connection.tsx)
Updated `onNotification` handlers to:
1. Extract event type and payload from WebSocket message
2. Determine viewer info based on event type:
   - `channel.chat.message` → `chatter_user_id`, `chatter_user_login`, `chatter_user_name`
   - Most events → `user_id`, `user_login`, `user_name`
   - Raid events → `from_broadcaster_user_id`, `from_broadcaster_user_login`, `from_broadcaster_user_name`
3. Create/update viewer record if viewer info exists
4. Store event with viewer linkage

Applied to both auto-reconnect handler and initial connection handler.

### Menu Updates (src/frontend/app.tsx)
- Added "Events" menu item
- Added "Chat" menu item
- Updated routing to handle all three screens (Connection, Events, Chat)
- Loads current session to pass channelId to Events and Chat screens
- Auto-refreshes session every 5 seconds

## User Experience

### Events Screen Usage
1. Navigate to "Events" in the menu
2. All events from the current channel are displayed
3. Use filters to narrow down:
   - Select event type from dropdown
   - Type search terms (e.g., "raid", "test message")
   - Set date range
4. Click "Clear Filters" to reset
5. Click "Refresh" to manually reload
6. Click any event row to view full details
7. Use pagination to browse through events

### Chat Screen Usage
1. Navigate to "Chat" in the menu
2. Historical chat messages load from database
3. New messages appear in real-time
4. Adjust "Max Messages" to change limit
5. Toggle "Auto-scroll" if you want to scroll manually
6. Click "Clear Display" to clear the view (data remains in DB)
7. Navigate away and back - messages persist

### Event Storage
Events are automatically stored when:
- WebSocket receives an EventSub notification
- IRC detects a join/part event

Viewers are automatically tracked when:
- An event contains user information
- A viewer record is created on first appearance
- Username/display name updated on subsequent events

## Configuration

### Settings Stored in Database
- `chat_max_messages` - Maximum chat messages to display (default: 100)
- All existing settings preserved

### Event Types Supported
All EventSub event types defined in `event-types.ts`:
- Channel events (subscribe, cheer, raid, etc.)
- Chat events (message, clear, delete, etc.)
- Point/Reward events
- Hype Train
- Polls & Predictions
- Stream events (online/offline)
- Goal events
- Shield Mode
- Shoutout events
- IRC events (join/part)

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Pagination to limit query results
- Prepared statements for all database queries
- Efficient JOIN queries for viewer data

### Security
- All database queries use parameterized statements (no SQL injection)
- Event data stored as JSON strings
- CodeQL security scan passed with 0 vulnerabilities
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity

### Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Webpack bundling successful
- ✅ No compilation errors or warnings
- ✅ All files generated correctly

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Connect to Twitch**
   - Authenticate with Twitch OAuth
   - Subscribe to events (ensure `channel.chat.message` is enabled)

3. **Generate test events**
   - Send chat messages
   - Trigger other events if possible (raids, subscriptions, etc.)

4. **Test Events Screen**
   - Navigate to Events
   - Verify events appear
   - Test each filter type
   - Test search functionality
   - Test pagination
   - Click an event to view details
   - Verify viewer names display correctly

5. **Test Chat Screen**
   - Navigate to Chat
   - Verify messages appear in real-time
   - Navigate to Connection, then back to Chat
   - Verify messages persisted
   - Change max messages setting
   - Test auto-scroll toggle
   - Test clear display button

6. **Test IRC Events** (if IRC is enabled)
   - Monitor join/part events
   - Verify they appear in Events screen
   - Check they're categorized correctly

### Database Verification
Inspect the database directly:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/stream-synth/stream-synth.db
```

**Windows:**
```bash
sqlite3 %APPDATA%\stream-synth\stream-synth.db
```

**SQL Commands:**
```sql
-- Check tables exist
.tables

-- View viewers
SELECT * FROM viewers LIMIT 10;

-- View events
SELECT * FROM events LIMIT 10;

-- Count events by type
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM events 
GROUP BY event_type 
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- View chat messages with users
SELECT 
  e.id,
  e.created_at,
  v.username,
  json_extract(e.event_data, '$.message.text') as message
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN viewers v ON e.viewer_id = v.id
WHERE e.event_type = 'channel.chat.message'
ORDER BY e.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
