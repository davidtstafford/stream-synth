## Test 5: Event Types Coverage 🎯

### Send Various Events:
1. [ ] Chat message → Should appear + TTS
2. [ ] Follow (if possible) → Should appear in Events
3. [ ] Ban user → Should appear in Events
4. [ ] Unban user → Should appear in Events

### Check Each Event:
- [ ] Appears in Events screen
- [ ] No duplicates
- [ ] Correct data displayed

### ✅ Success Criteria:
- All event types work
- Zero duplicates for any type

---

## Verification Checklist

### Console Logs (Backend):
- [ ] `[EventRouter] Processing chat message from: ...`
- [ ] `[EventRouter] ✓ Chat message stored from: ...`
- [ ] `[EventRouter→TTS] Forwarding chat to TTS: ...`
- [ ] No duplicate storage logs

### Browser Console (Frontend):
- [ ] `Received event notification: Object`
- [ ] `📝 Event type: channel.chat.message`
- [ ] `👥 Creating/updating viewer: ...`
- [ ] No duplicate event processing

### Database Check:
```sql
-- Run this to check for duplicates
SELECT event_type, timestamp, COUNT(*) as count
FROM events
GROUP BY event_type, timestamp
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Expected:** Zero results (no duplicates)

---

## Known Issues (Expected)

### ✅ These are NORMAL:
- IRC messages show `(ignored for TTS)` - This is intentional
- EventSub keepalive messages every ~10s - Normal
- WebSocket reconnections - Normal

### ❌ These are PROBLEMS:
- `getTokens is not a function` - Should be fixed
- Duplicate events in database - Should be fixed
- TTS not reading messages - Should be fixed
- Moderation actions failing - Check OAuth reconnect

---

## If Something Fails

### TTS Not Working:
1. Check Settings → TTS → Enabled
2. Check logs for `[EventRouter→TTS]`
3. Test with Web Speech voice first
4. Check audio output device

### Events Duplicated:
1. Clear database
2. Restart app
3. Verify you pulled latest code
4. Check logs for double-storage

### Moderation Actions Fail:
1. **Did you reconnect to Twitch?** (REQUIRED)
2. Check OAuth scopes in database
3. Check API response in logs
4. Verify you have mod permissions

### Real-Time Not Working:
1. Check EventSub connection status
2. Look for `event:stored` IPC events
3. Restart application
4. Check WebSocket logs

---

## Success! 🎉

When all tests pass, you should have:

✅ **TTS working** - Chat messages read aloud  
✅ **Zero duplicates** - Clean database  
✅ **Real-time events** - Instant UI updates  
✅ **Moderation working** - Ban/unban functional  
✅ **Stable connection** - EventSub WebSocket solid

- [ ] All tests passed ✅
- [ ] Some tests failed ❌ (which ones?)
