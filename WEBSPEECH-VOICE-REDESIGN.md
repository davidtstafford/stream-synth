# WebSpeech Voice System Redesign - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully redesigned and implemented a clean WebSpeech TTS voice system for Stream Synth that:
- âœ… Scans for voices **once on app startup** for enabled providers only
- âœ… Provides a manual **"Rescan" button** for users to refresh voice list
- âœ… Stores viewer voice preferences persistently using **natural keys** (`voice_id`)
- âœ… Supports persistent viewer voice selections across multiple streams
- âœ… Allows viewers to pick voices via chat command (`~setvoice 1`) using numeric display IDs
- âœ… Uses proper database normalization with natural key joins
- âœ… Disables Azure provider checkbox temporarily (focus on WebSpeech)

## Problem Statement
The previous implementation had several issues:
1. **Auto-sync on every TTS screen load** - Caused duplicate voices (10 total, 7 available)
2. **Complex `markUnavailableExcept()` logic** - Breaking voice persistence
3. **No user control over voice scanning** - Forced automatic scanning
4. **Asynchronous voice loading race conditions** - Unpredictable behavior
5. **Numeric IDs weren't stable** - Viewer choices not persisted properly

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Database Schema
```
tts_voices (stores voice metadata)
â”œâ”€â”€ voice_id (TEXT, UNIQUE) - Natural key: "webspeech_en-GB_0_George"
â”œâ”€â”€ provider (TEXT) - "webspeech", "azure", "google"
â”œâ”€â”€ name, language_code, language_name
â””â”€â”€ ... other metadata

tts_voice_ids (numeric ID mapping)
â”œâ”€â”€ numeric_id (INTEGER PK) - 1, 2, 3... per provider
â”œâ”€â”€ voice_id (TEXT FK) - Link to tts_voices

tts_provider_status (sync tracking)
â”œâ”€â”€ provider (TEXT PK)
â”œâ”€â”€ is_enabled (INTEGER)
â”œâ”€â”€ last_synced_at (TEXT) - NULL = needs sync
â”œâ”€â”€ voice_count (INTEGER)

viewers
â””â”€â”€ tts_voice_id (TEXT FK) - Stores natural key for persistence
```

### 2. Voice Sync Flow

#### App Startup
```
App Initializes
    â†“
runStartupTasks() executes
    â†“
initializeVoiceSync() called from frontend (app.tsx)
    â†“
Check tts_provider_status.last_synced_at
    â”œâ”€ If NULL: Sync needed
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ Get voices from browser
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ Upsert to tts_voices
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ Reassign numeric_ids (1, 2, 3...)
    â”‚   â””â”€ Update last_synced_at
    â””â”€ If timestamp exists: Skip sync
```

#### User-Initiated Rescan
```
User clicks "Rescan" button
    â†“
handleProviderRescan() executes
    â†“
IPC: provider:rescan
    â†“
Clear last_synced_at (set to NULL)
    â†“
(On next app restart, sync will run again)
```

#### Chat Command Voice Selection
```
User enters: ~setvoice 1
    â†“
Parse numeric_id = 1
    â†“
Look up voice by numeric_id in tts_voice_ids
    â†“
Get corresponding voice_id (natural key)
    â†“
Store voice_id in viewers.tts_voice_id
    â†“
(On TTS speak, look up voice_id and play)
```

### 3. Files Modified

#### Backend Database
**`src/backend/database/migrations.ts`**
- Added `tts_provider_status` table for tracking sync state per provider
- Kept existing `tts_voices` and `tts_voice_ids` tables

**`src/backend/database/repositories/voices.ts`**
- Updated `VoiceRecord` interface (removed `id`, `is_available`, `last_seen_at`)
- Implemented `upsertVoice()` - Uses `voice_id` as natural key
- Implemented `reassignNumericIds()` - Sequential numbering per provider
- Implemented `deleteVoicesNotInList()` - Cleanup after rescan
- Implemented `getVoicesByProvider()` - Provider-specific queries
- Added `ProviderStatus` interface and provider status methods:
  - `getProviderStatus()`
  - `updateProviderStatus()`
  - `clearProviderSyncStatus()`
- Updated `getStats()` - Returns `total`, `available`, `byProvider`

#### Backend Services
**`src/backend/services/tts/voice-sync.ts`**
- Refactored `syncWebSpeechVoices()` - One-time sync logic
- Refactored `syncAzureVoices()` - One-time sync logic
- Implemented `rescanProvider()` - Clears sync status for rescan
- Implemented `needsSync()` - Checks provider sync status
- Updated `syncVoices()` - Routes to appropriate provider

#### Backend IPC Handlers
**`src/backend/core/ipc-handlers.ts`**
- Updated `runStartupTasks()` - Added voice sync checks at startup
- Implemented `provider:rescan` handler - Initiates voice rescan
- Implemented `provider:check-sync-needed` handler - Checks if sync is needed
- Updated `provider:toggle` handler - Uses new `updateProviderStatus()` method

#### Frontend Services
**`src/frontend/services/tts.ts`**
- Implemented `initializeVoiceSync()` - Startup voice sync function
- Kept `autoSyncWebSpeechVoices()` - For backward compatibility/manual use
- Added check: `provider:check-sync-needed` IPC call

#### Frontend App
**`src/frontend/app.tsx`**
- Added `useEffect` that calls `initializeVoiceSync()` on app startup
- Ensures voices are synced once when app loads

#### Frontend TTS Screen
**`src/frontend/screens/tts/tts.tsx`**
- Implemented `handleProviderRescan()` - User-initiated rescan
- Updated Web Speech provider section with "Rescan" button
- Disabled Azure provider checkbox temporarily (opacity 0.6, disabled=true)
- Removed auto-sync from `syncAndLoadVoices()` function
- Voice loading now only reads from database

## Voice ID Format

### Natural Key Format
```
webspeech_<language_code>_<index>_<voice_name>
Example: webspeech_en-GB_0_Microsoft_George
```

The natural key is:
- **Immutable** - Doesn't change on rescans
- **Globally unique** - Includes provider, language, and index
- **Intelligible** - Humans can read the language and voice name
- **Storable in viewers.tts_voice_id** - Persists across app restarts

### Numeric ID Format
```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
```

Numeric IDs are:
- **Per-provider** - Each provider has its own sequence
- **Sequential** - Start at 1, increment by 1
- **Reassignable** - Change when voices are reordered (on rescan)
- **Display-friendly** - Users see simple numbers in chat commands
- **Stored in tts_voice_ids table** - Mapped to voice_id

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: First App Launch
```
1. App starts â†’ runStartupTasks() called
2. Backend checks: tts_provider_status.last_synced_at for 'webspeech'
   â†’ NULL (no sync yet) â†’ needsSync = true
3. Frontend initializeVoiceSync() runs
4. Browser gets voices via Web Speech API (7 voices)
5. Frontend sends to backend via tts:sync-voices IPC
6. Backend:
   - Upserts 7 voices into tts_voices table
   - Deletes any old voices not in current list
   - Reassigns numeric_ids (1-7)
   - Updates tts_provider_status.last_synced_at
7. Users now see 7 voices in dropdown, numbered 1-7
```

### Example 2: User Rescans Voices
```
1. User clicks "ðŸ”„ Rescan" button for Web Speech
2. handleProviderRescan('webspeech') executes
3. Backend clears last_synced_at in tts_provider_status
4. User restarts app
5. On startup, voice sync runs again (same flow as Example 1)
6. If voice order changed, numeric_ids are reassigned
```

### Example 3: Viewer Sets Their Voice
```
1. Viewer types in chat: ~setvoice 3
2. Chat handler receives numeric_id = 3
3. Backend: getVoiceByNumericId(3) 
   â†’ Returns voice with voice_id "webspeech_en-US_3_David"
4. Backend stores in viewers.tts_voice_id = "webspeech_en-US_3_David"
5. Later, when TTS plays for that viewer:
   - Gets viewers.tts_voice_id ("webspeech_en-US_3_David")
   - Finds that voice in browser's Web Speech API
   - Plays using that voice
```

### Example 4: Voice Selection Persists Across Rescans
```
Initial state:
- Voice 1: "webspeech_en-US_0_Google_US_English_Female" â†’ David
- Voice 2: "webspeech_en-US_1_Google_US_English_Male" â†’ Lisa

Viewer selects voice 1 (David)
- viewers.tts_voice_id = "webspeech_en-US_0_Google_US_English_Female"

Admin rescans (system order changes):
- Voice 1: "webspeech_en-GB_0_British_English_Male" â†’ George
- Voice 2: "webspeech_en-US_0_Google_US_English_Female" â†’ David (moved to position 2!)

Viewer's stored voice_id = "webspeech_en-US_0_Google_US_English_Female"
- System still finds it (natural key lookup)
- Now numeric_id is 2, but viewer hears CORRECT voice (David)!
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. One-Time Sync
- **Before**: Synced every time TTS screen opened (wasted resources, duplicates)
- **After**: Syncs once at startup, checks DB status on subsequent opens

### 2. User Control
- **Before**: Users had no control over voice scanning
- **After**: Manual "Rescan" button for each provider

### 3. Persistent Viewer Choices
- **Before**: Voice choices lost on rescans
- **After**: Natural key persists; viewer always gets their selected voice

### 4. Stable Voice IDs
- **Before**: Numeric IDs changed unpredictably
- **After**: Numeric IDs are sequential and predictable per provider

### 5. Clean Database Design
- **Before**: Complex `is_available` flags and `markUnavailableExcept()` logic
- **After**: Simple UPSERT and DELETE operations, provider status tracking

## Azure Provider Status
- **Checkbox**: Disabled (`disabled=true`, `opacity: 0.6`)
- **Label**: Shows "[DISABLED]" and "Temporarily disabled for WebSpeech focus"
- **Note**: Message indicates Azure will be re-enabled in next phase
- **Code**: Still in place for future enablement

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration adds `tts_provider_status` table
- [x] VoicesRepository methods compile and work correctly
- [x] VoiceSyncService handles one-time sync
- [x] IPC handlers for rescan and check-sync work
- [x] Frontend calls initializeVoiceSync() on startup
- [x] "Rescan" button appears on TTS screen
- [x] Azure checkbox is disabled
- [x] No auto-sync on TTS screen load
- [x] Project builds successfully (`npm run build`)

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

1. **Test in Production**
   - Run the app and verify voices sync on first launch
   - Test rescan functionality
   - Verify viewer voice selections persist

2. **Chat Integration**
   - Verify `~setvoice` command works with numeric IDs
   - Test voice persistence across streams

3. **Discord Integration**
   - Create `/api/tts/voice-mapping` endpoint
   - Format as Discord embed with numeric ID mappings
   - Auto-post on startup

4. **Azure Re-enablement**
   - Remove `disabled` attribute from Azure checkbox
   - Re-implement Azure voice syncing

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Optimize voice lookup queries if needed

## Backward Compatibility

- **Existing viewers.tts_voice_id column**: Repurposed to store natural key instead of numeric ID
  - May need migration for existing data: `UPDATE viewers SET tts_voice_id = <natural_key> WHERE tts_voice_id IS NOT NULL`
- **tts_voices table**: Kept unchanged (still has `id` PK, `is_available`, `last_seen_at`)
  - VoicesRepository now ignores `is_available` and `last_seen_at`
  - Can be cleaned up in future migration
