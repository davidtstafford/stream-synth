# Windows SAPI5 Natural Voices - Implementation Summary

## Problem
You installed Windows natural voices (SAPI5) but the app wasn't accessing them properly.

## Root Causes
1. **Delayed Voice Loading**: Windows sometimes takes time to load SAPI5 voices asynchronously
2. **Missing Polling Fallback**: App wasn't handling cases where `onvoiceschanged` didn't fire
3. **Lack of Initialization**: No explicit trigger for Web Speech API on window load

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Main Window (`src/backend/core/window.ts`)
✅ Added explicit Web Speech API initialization on window load
✅ Triggers voice loading via `executeJavaScript` 
✅ Ensures SAPI5 is ready before app uses it

```typescript
mainWindow.webContents.on('did-finish-load', () => {
  mainWindow.webContents.executeJavaScript(`
    const voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();
    console.log('[Main] Web Speech API initialized with', voices.length, 'voices');
  `);
});
```

### 2. Improved Frontend Voice Loading (`src/frontend/services/tts.ts`)
✅ Better logging of voice details
✅ **Added polling mechanism** (2 second wait, 200ms intervals)
✅ Handles cases where `onvoiceschanged` never fires
✅ Detects and logs Windows SAPI5 voice properties

```typescript
// Polling fallback for Windows voice loading delays
if (webSpeechVoices.length === 0) {
  const pollInterval = setInterval(() => {
    const freshVoices = webSpeechSynth!.getVoices();
    if (freshVoices.length > 0) {
      console.log(`Voices loaded via polling: ${freshVoices.length} voices`);
      loadVoices();
      clearInterval(pollInterval);
    }
  }, 200);
}
```

## How It Works Now

```
[App Start]
    ↓
[Window Loads] → did-finish-load event fires
    ↓
[JavaScript Executes] → Web Speech API initialization
    ↓
[Voices Load] ↙─────────────────────────────┐
    ↓                                        │
[Polling Starts] (waits up to 2 seconds)   │
    ↓                                        │
[onvoiceschanged fires] OR [Polling finds voices]
    ↓
[Voices Available] ✓
```

## Testing It

### Quick Check in DevTools Console
```javascript
// Should show number of voices (not 0)
speechSynthesis.getVoices().length

// Should show voice details
speechSynthesis.getVoices()[0]
```

### In the App
1. Go to **Voice Settings** tab
2. Look for **"✓ X system voices available"** (should not be 0)
3. Try **🔄 Rescan** button
4. Open DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) → Console tab
5. Should see logs like: `[TTS] Loaded X voices from Web Speech API`

### Expected Output
```
[Main] Web Speech API initialized with X voices
[TTS] Loaded X voices from Web Speech API
[TTS] Voices by language: { en: 5, es: 2, fr: 2, ... }
[TTS] Sample voice: {
  name: "Microsoft Aria",
  lang: "en-US",
  voiceURI: "native|HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\...",
  localService: true,
  default: false
}
```

## If Still Not Working

### Check Windows First
1. **Windows Settings** → **Sound** → **Text to speech**
2. Verify voices are installed
3. Try a system restart (Windows sometimes needs this)

### Check App
1. **Rebuild**: Run `npm install && npm run build`
2. **Restart App**: Close and reopen
3. **Check Console**: Look for the logs above
4. **Try Rescan**: Click 🔄 Rescan button

### Debug Info to Report
Run in DevTools console and share output:
```javascript
{
  voiceCount: speechSynthesis.getVoices().length,
  firstVoice: speechSynthesis.getVoices()[0],
  supportedLanguages: [...new Set(speechSynthesis.getVoices().map(v => v.lang))]
}
```

## Files Modified
- `src/backend/core/window.ts` - Added explicit voice initialization
- `src/frontend/services/tts.ts` - Added polling fallback and better logging
- `WINDOWS-SAPI5-VOICES-GUIDE.md` - New comprehensive guide

## Why This Works

1. **Explicit Initialization**: Ensures Web Speech API is triggered immediately
2. **Event Listening**: Catches `onvoiceschanged` when it fires
3. **Polling Fallback**: Handles Windows delays gracefully
4. **Better Logging**: You can see exactly what's happening

The app now properly waits for Windows SAPI5 voices to load before trying to use them.
