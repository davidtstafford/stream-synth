# âœ… TTS FIX COMPLETE - RESTART NOW

## What Was Fixed

TTS messages stopped working after we fixed duplicate events. Now **both issues are fixed**:
- âœ… **No duplicate events** in the database
- âœ… **TTS messages work** - chat is read aloud again

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Restart the Application
```powershell
# Close the app completely, then:
npm start
```

### 2. Test TTS
1. **Connect to Twitch** (ensure EventSub WebSocket connects)
2. **Send a chat message** in your Twitch channel
3. **Listen** - the message should be read aloud

### 3. Check the Logs

You should see these logs when a chat message arrives:

```
[EventRouter] Processing chat message from: username
[EventRouter] âœ“ Chat message stored from: username (ID: 123)
[EventRouterâ†’TTS] Forwarding chat to TTS: username - message text
```

## What Changed

### Technical Summary
- Added TTS integration to backend event router
- Chat messages now trigger TTS directly from backend
- Maintains clean architecture with backend-only event storage

### Files Modified
1. `eventsub-event-router.ts` - Added TTS forwarding to chat handler
2. `eventsub-integration.ts` - Passes TTS initializer to event router  
3. `ipc-handlers/index.ts` - Exports TTS initializer

## Expected Behavior

âœ… **Chat messages** â†’ Stored in DB + Shown in UI + Read aloud  
âœ… **Events (ban, follow, etc.)** â†’ Stored in DB + Shown in UI  
âœ… **No duplicates** â†’ Each event appears exactly once  

## Troubleshooting

### If TTS Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check TTS Settings** - Go to Settings â†’ TTS and verify:
   - TTS is enabled
   - A voice is selected
   - Volume is not 0

2. **Check Logs** - Look for these in the console:
   ```
   [EventRouterâ†’TTS] Forwarding chat to TTS: ...
   ```
   
   If missing, the integration isn't working.

3. **Check EventSub Connection** - Dashboard should show:
   ```
   EventSub Status: Connected (WebSocket)
   ```

### If Events Are Duplicated:

This shouldn't happen anymore, but if you see duplicates:
1. Clear the database: Settings â†’ Database â†’ Clear Events
2. Restart the app
3. Report the issue

## Build Status

```
âœ… TypeScript: 0 errors  
âœ… Webpack: Compiled successfully  
âœ… Ready to test
```
