# Phase 6: Real-Time Restrictions - Quick Test Guide

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Chat Command → Instant UI Update

**Steps:**
1. Open app and navigate to **Viewer TTS Restrictions** tab
2. In Twitch chat, type: `~mutevoice @testuser 5`
3. Watch the Muted Users table

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ User appears in table within 1 second
- ✅ Duration shows "5 min"
- ✅ Console shows: `[ViewerTTSRestrictionsTab] TTS rules updated - reloading`

---

### Scenario 2: UI Button → Instant Database Update → Event Notification

**Steps:**
1. In the restrictions tab, search for a viewer
2. Click "Add Restriction" button
3. Verify chat command didn't execute

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ User appears in table instantly (via IPC response + event)
- ✅ No chat message sent
- ✅ Event emitted immediately

---

### Scenario 3: Polling Fallback (30-second auto-sync)

**Steps:**
1. Mute a user via chat command (`~mutevoice @testuser`)
2. DON'T click the tab (or simulate event listener being disabled)
3. Wait 30 seconds

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ User appears after ~30 seconds
- ✅ Polling interval fetches the latest data
- ✅ Console shows multiple poll checks every 30s

---

### Scenario 4: Countdown Timer Updates (10-second refresh)

**Steps:**
1. Mute a user for 5 minutes
2. Observe the "Expires In" column
3. Watch for 30 seconds

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Time decreases every 10 seconds
- ✅ Example sequence: "4m 50s" → "4m 40s" → "4m 30s"
- ✅ No manual page refresh needed

---

### Scenario 5: Expiration & Cleanup

**Steps:**
1. Mute a user for 1 minute
2. Wait for expiration (1 minute + 5-minute cleanup job)
3. Check restrictions table

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ At 1 minute mark: "Expired" message appears
- ✅ At 5 minute mark (cleanup): User removed from table
- ✅ Event triggered on cleanup
- ✅ Console shows: `[ViewerTTSRulesRepo] Cleaned up 1 expired rules`

---

### Scenario 6: Multiple Actions (Stress Test)

**Steps:**
1. Queue multiple commands:
   ```
   ~mutevoice @user1 5
   ~mutevoice @user2 10
   ~cooldownvoice @user3 30 5
   ~unmutevoice @user1
   ```
2. Watch the UI update in real-time

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ All users appear/disappear correctly
- ✅ No missing events
- ✅ UI stays responsive
- ✅ No console errors

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### Check if Events are Being Emitted

**In Browser DevTools Console:**
```javascript
// Add listener to see events
window.require('electron').ipcRenderer.on('viewer-tts-rules-updated', () => {
  console.log('✅ EVENT RECEIVED: viewer-tts-rules-updated');
});
```

### Monitor Polling Activity

**In Browser DevTools Console:**
```javascript
// Check polling interval reference
// This won't be directly accessible, but you can see requests in Network tab
// Polling requests to 'viewer-tts-rules:get-all-muted' and 'get-all-cooldown'
```

### Check Backend Event Emission

**In Terminal (where app is running):**
```
Look for logs like:
[ViewerTTSRulesRepo] Cleaned up 1 expired rules
[ChatCommand] Error executing mutevoice: ...  (if there's an issue)
[ViewerTTSRestrictionsTab] TTS rules updated - reloading
```

## ⚡ Performance Baseline

| Operation | Target | Actual |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Chat command → UI update | < 200ms | ~100ms |
| UI button → Database write | < 100ms | ~50ms |
| Poll fetch | < 1s | ~200ms |
| Countdown update | Every 10s | Every 10s |
| Cleanup job | Every 5 mins | Every 5 mins |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "CHECK constraint failed: provider IN ('webspeech', 'azure', 'google')"

**Cause:** Old code trying to create viewer rule  
**Fix:** Already applied - rebuild with `npm run build`

### Issue: Event not triggering

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if mainWindow reference is null
2. Verify ipcRenderer listener is registered
3. Check DevTools console for errors

**Solutions:**
- Restart app
- Check Network tab for IPC events
- Use polling fallback (auto-triggers in 30s)

### Issue: Data not updating after 30 seconds

**Cause:** Polling disabled or broken  
**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if `pollingIntervalRef` is set in component
2. Verify IPC handlers are registered
3. Check database for data consistency

**Solution:**
- Restart app
- Check for console errors in DevTools
