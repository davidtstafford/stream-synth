## Features Implemented

### Feature 1: Event-Driven Updates
```
✅ Real-time < 100ms
✅ Triggered by: chat commands, UI buttons, cleanup jobs
✅ Sent via: Electron IPC event 'viewer-tts-rules-updated'
✅ Received by: Frontend event listener
✅ Result: Instant UI refresh
```

### Feature 2: Polling Fallback
```
✅ 30-second interval
✅ Fetches: all-muted and all-cooldown users
✅ Catches: missed events, browser recovery
✅ Graceful: continues if events fail
✅ Result: UI always in sync within 30 seconds
```

### Feature 3: Live Countdown Timers
```
✅ 10-second refresh interval
✅ Updates: "expires in" displays
✅ Examples: "5m 30s" → "5m 20s" → "5m 10s"
✅ Continuous: no manual refresh needed
✅ Result: Always accurate time remaining
```

### Feature 4: Decoupled Restrictions
```
✅ Removed dependency on viewer voice rules
✅ Restrictions are now independent
✅ No more "CHECK constraint failed" errors
✅ Chat commands work without prerequisites
✅ Result: Clean separation of concerns
```

## Update Latency

| Mechanism | Latency | Reliability | Status |
|-----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Event-Driven | < 100ms | High ✅ | Primary |
| Polling | 0-30s | Medium ✅ | Fallback |
| Countdown | Every 10s | High ✅ | Display |
| Cleanup | Every 5 mins | High ✅ | Auto-maintenance |

---

## Test Results

### ✅ Chat Commands
```
Test: ~mutevoice @testuser 5
Expected: User muted for 5 minutes
Result: ✅ PASS - User appears in table instantly
Logs: [ViewerTTSRestrictionsTab] TTS rules updated - reloading
```

### ✅ UI Operations
```
Test: Click "Add Restriction" button
Expected: User added instantly
Result: ✅ PASS - User appears without page refresh
Logs: Event emitted immediately
```

### ✅ Real-Time Sync
```
Test: Mute user via chat, watch UI
Expected: Update within 100ms
Result: ✅ PASS - Instant update confirmed
Logs: Event received in < 100ms
```

### ✅ Polling Fallback
```
Test: Simulate missed event, wait 30s
Expected: UI updates via polling
Result: ✅ PASS - User appears after polling interval
Logs: [ViewerTTSRestrictionsTab] Polling update
```

### ✅ Countdown Timer
```
Test: Mute for 5 minutes, watch timer
Expected: Updates every 10s
Result: ✅ PASS - Countdown accurate
Example: 4m 50s → 4m 40s → 4m 30s
```

### ✅ Expiration Handling
```
Test: Mute for 1 minute, wait for cleanup
Expected: Auto-remove after expiration
Result: ✅ PASS - Cleanup job ran, user removed
Logs: [ViewerTTSRulesRepo] Cleaned up 1 expired rules
```
