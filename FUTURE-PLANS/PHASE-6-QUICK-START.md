# Phase 6: Quick Reference Guide

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

---

## What Was Built

Real-time updates for the Viewer TTS Restrictions screen with:
- 🔔 **Event-driven updates** < 100ms (primary)
- 📊 **Auto-polling** 30s interval (fallback)
- ⏱️ **Live timers** 10s refresh (UI)
- ✅ **Bug fixes** Removed viewer rule dependency

---

## Quick Test

### Test Real-Time Updates
```powershell
# 1. Start app
npm start

# 2. In Twitch chat (as mod), run:
~mutevoice @testuser 5

# 3. Expected in UI (instant):
- testuser appears in "Muted Users" table
- Duration shows "5 min"
- Time remaining shows "⏱️ 4m 50s"

# 4. Watch countdown:
Every 10 seconds it updates: 4m 40s → 4m 30s → 4m 20s...

# 5. Remove restriction:
Click "Unmute" button
Expected: User disappears instantly
```
