## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Phase 8: EventSub Styling Changes

**File:** `src/frontend/screens/system/eventsub-dashboard.tsx`

**Color Updates:**
```
Background:    #fafafa → #1a1a1a (light to dark)
Cards:         white → #2a2a2a (light to dark)
Text:          #333 → #fff (dark to light)
Buttons:       #2196f3 → #9147ff (blue to purple)
Borders:       #e0e0e0 → #444 (light to dark)
Success:       #4caf50 (unchanged - green)
Error:         #f44336 (unchanged - red)
```

**Status:** ✅ All inline styles updated for dark theme consistency

### Phase 9: Advanced Screen Tab Components

**Created Components:**

1. **BackupRestoreTab.tsx** (22 lines)
   ```typescript
   - Props: userId, onImportComplete
   - Renders: ExportImport component
   - Purpose: Data backup and restoration
   ```

2. **TwitchPollingTab.tsx** (283 lines)
   ```typescript
   - Polling configuration UI
   - Interval adjustment (3000-60000ms)
   - Enable/disable toggle
   - Last sync timestamp display
   - Auto-refresh capability
   ```

3. **EventSubStatusTab.tsx** (18 lines)
   ```typescript
   - Wrapper component
   - Props: userId, accessToken, clientId, broadcasterId
   - Renders: EventSubDashboard
   - Import: ./EventSubDashboard (relative path)
   ```

**Main Screen Refactor:**

**advanced.tsx** (125 lines, reduced from 392)
```typescript
- Tab state management (activeTab: 'backup' | 'polling' | 'eventsub')
- Tab navigation buttons with purple accent
- Conditional rendering of tab components
- Props properly distributed to children
- Follows TTS/Viewers screen patterns
```

**Modified:** `src/frontend/app.tsx`
```typescript
- Removed: import { EventSubDashboard } from './screens/system/eventsub-dashboard'
- Removed: { id: 'eventsub', label: 'EventSub', isBottom: true } menu item
- Removed: case 'eventsub' from renderScreen()
- Result: EventSub only accessible via Advanced Settings tab
```

### Phase 10: System Folder Migration

**Migration Path:**
```
FROM: src/frontend/screens/system/eventsub-dashboard.tsx
TO:   src/frontend/screens/advanced/tabs/EventSubDashboard.tsx
```

**Import Updates:**

```typescript
// Before (EventSubStatusTab.tsx)
import { EventSubDashboard } from '../../system/eventsub-dashboard';

// After (EventSubStatusTab.tsx)
import { EventSubDashboard } from './EventSubDashboard';
```

**Service Imports in EventSubDashboard:**
```typescript
// Before location: src/frontend/screens/system/
import * as eventsubService from '../../services/eventsub';

// After location: src/frontend/screens/advanced/tabs/
import * as eventsubService from '../../../services/eventsub';
```

**Dependency Verification:**
- Grep search: 0 other imports from `screens/system`
- Only dependent: EventSubStatusTab.tsx (import updated)
- Safe to remove: ✅ YES

**Folder Deletion:**
- Deleted: `src/frontend/screens/system/` directory
- Contents: eventsub-dashboard.tsx (migrated), eventsub-dashboard.module.css (no longer used)
- Verification: 0 orphaned files or folders remaining
