## 📋 Testing Sequence

### Test 1: Application Startup (1 minute)
```
1. Open terminal: cd c:\git\staffy\stream-synth
2. Run: npm run build
3. Expected: 0 errors, bundle created
4. Run: npm start
5. Expected: App window opens, no console errors
6. Check: Viewers screen displays table
```

### Test 2: Viewer Modal Open (2 minutes)
```
1. Click "Viewers" tab if not already there
2. Wait for viewers to load
3. Click on any viewer row
4. Expected: Modal opens (no black screen)
5. Check: Modal displays viewer name/ID
6. Check: Status badges visible
7. Check: Timeline displays
8. Check: Statistics show
```

### Test 3: Modal Navigation (2 minutes)
```
1. Click different viewers
2. Expected: Each opens correct modal
3. Expected: Different data for each viewer
4. Click X button or outside modal
5. Expected: Modal closes
6. Click another viewer
7. Expected: Modal opens again
```

### Test 4: Console Check (1 minute)
```
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Perform: Start app, click viewers, open modal
4. Expected: No red error messages
5. Expected: No "Cannot read properties" errors
6. Expected: No "undefined" errors
```

### Test 5: Moderation Actions (3 minutes, optional)
```
1. Click "⚡ Moderation Actions" in modal
2. Expected: Panel expands
3. Check: Ban, Timeout, Mod, VIP buttons visible
4. Optional: Click action (if credentials set)
5. Expected: Action processes or shows error
```

## ✨ Success Indicators

### All of These Should Be True
- ✅ Application starts without crashing
- ✅ Modal opens when clicking viewer
- ✅ Modal displays all viewer information
- ✅ Timeline shows with proper formatting
- ✅ Statistics display correctly
- ✅ No black screen appears
- ✅ No console errors appear
- ✅ Modal can be closed cleanly
- ✅ Can open multiple viewers without issues
- ✅ Actions panel opens/closes smoothly

### Any of These Would Indicate a Problem
- ❌ Application crashes on startup
- ❌ Modal shows black screen
- ❌ Console shows "Cannot read properties" error
- ❌ Console shows "undefined" errors
- ❌ Timeline doesn't display
- ❌ Statistics are missing
- ❌ Status badges don't show
- ❌ Modal won't close
- ❌ Clicking another viewer doesn't update modal
- ❌ Performance is noticeably slow

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### If: Application won't start
**Check**: Database initialization in database.ts
- [ ] Verify lazy getters at lines 31-67
- [ ] Verify all handlers use getter functions
- [ ] Run: `npm clean-install && npm run build`

### If: Modal shows black screen
**Check**: Optional chaining in viewer-detail-modal.tsx
- [ ] Verify 8 property access chains use `?.` at every level
- [ ] Check lines: 306, 319, 330, 348, 356, 645
- [ ] Run: `npm run build` (no errors)
- [ ] Refresh browser and try again

### If: TypeScript compilation fails
**Check**: Build environment
- [ ] Delete `node_modules` folder
- [ ] Delete `dist` folder
- [ ] Run: `npm clean-install`
- [ ] Run: `npm run build`

### If: Modal loads slowly
**Check**: Database queries
- [ ] Verify database is initialized
- [ ] Check network tab in DevTools
- [ ] Verify no console errors during load
- [ ] Check if IPC call completes

### If: Console shows warnings (not errors)
**Action**: These are likely okay
- Proceed with testing
- Monitor for actual errors (red in console)
- Report only if they grow or affect functionality

## 🎓 Knowledge Base

### Understanding the Fixes

**Lazy Initialization**:
- Problem: Repos instantiated too early
- Solution: Defer instantiation to first use
- Benefit: Avoids initialization order issues
- File: database.ts (12 lazy getters)

**Optional Chaining**:
- Problem: Incomplete chaining on nested properties
- Solution: Chain `?.` through all levels
- Benefit: Safe property access at every level
- File: viewer-detail-modal.tsx (8 fixes)

### Key Code Patterns

**Pattern 1: Lazy Getter**
```typescript
let instance: Type | null = null;
const getInstance = () => instance ??= new Type();
```

**Pattern 2: Safe Nested Access**
```typescript
// Before: obj?.prop.nested.value
// After: obj?.prop?.nested?.value
```
