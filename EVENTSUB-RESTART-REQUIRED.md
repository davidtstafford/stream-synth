## EventSub Dashboard Fix Applied âœ…

The EventSub Dashboard has been fixed to correctly display:
- âœ… Connection status (should show "Connected" instead of "Disconnected")
- âœ… Actual subscription count (43 instead of "0 / 8")
- âœ… All active subscriptions in the list

## IMPORTANT: You Must Restart the App

**The changes won't take effect until you:**
1. Close the Stream Synth application completely
2. Restart the application
3. Navigate to **System â†’ EventSub Dashboard**

## What You Should See After Restart

### Before Fix
```
Status: Disconnected ðŸ”´
Active Subscriptions: 0 / 8
Available Event Types: (8 cards shown)
Active Subscriptions: (section not visible)
```

### After Fix (After Restart)
```
Status: Connected ðŸŸ¢
Active Subscriptions: 43
Event Subscriptions: (8 cards shown with âœ“ marks)
Active Subscriptions: (43 items listed)
```

## Quick Test
1. Restart the app
2. Go to EventSub Dashboard
3. Verify "Connected" status appears
4. Verify subscription count shows 43
5. Scroll down to see all 43 active subscriptions listed

**The EventSub system is already working - the dashboard just needed to display it correctly!** ðŸŽ‰
