# Bug Fixes Complete - Phase 11

## Date: October 29, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Voice Settings Tab Black on Black Styling
**Problem:** Voice Settings screen had black background making sliders invisible, unlike other tabs with grey backgrounds.

**Solution:**
- Added `.voice-settings-tab` CSS class with `padding: 20px` to match other tabs
- Wrapped entire Voice Settings Tab content in `<div className="voice-settings-tab">` 
- Now matches the grey background styling of TTS Access Tab and Viewer Rules Tab

**Files Modified:**
- `src/frontend/screens/tts/tts.css` - Added `.voice-settings-tab` class
- `src/frontend/screens/tts/tabs/VoiceSettingsTab.tsx` - Wrapped content in styled div

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Channel Point Redeem UI Complete
**Status:** Already implemented correctly in previous phases.

**Features:**
- Text input for redeem name (placeholder: "Redeem name")
- Number input for duration in minutes (default: 60)
- Available in both Limited Access and Premium Voice Access modes
- Auto-initializes when checkbox is enabled

**No changes needed** - functionality was already complete.

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #3: Force-Enable Required EventSub Events
**Problem:** Channel point redeem functionality requires `channel.channel_points_custom_reward_redemption.add` event but user had to manually enable it.

**Solution:**
- Added state tracking for whether redeem event is enabled (`isRedeemEventEnabled`)
- Added `checkRedeemEventStatus()` function to query subscription status on load
- Added `enableRedeemEvent()` function to enable the event with one click
- Display warning box with "Enable Event Now" button when:
  - Channel point redeem is enabled (checkbox checked)
  - But the required EventSub event is not enabled
- Warning appears in both Limited Access and Premium Voice Access modes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/frontend/screens/tts/tabs/TTSAccessTab.tsx`:
  - Added `isRedeemEventEnabled` state
  - Added `checkRedeemEventStatus()` function
  - Added `enableRedeemEvent()` function  
  - Added warning boxes with enable buttons in both redeem sections

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #4: Add Validation Warnings
**Problem:** No warnings when Premium Voice Access mode conflicts with global voice settings (Azure/Google vs WebSpeech).

**Solution:**

#### Warning #1: Premium Voice Access with Azure/Google Global Voice
- Shows at top of TTS Access tab when:
  - Access mode is "Premium Voice Access"
  - Global voice provider is Azure or Google (not WebSpeech)
- Warning message:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Warning: Premium Voice Access mode should only be used 
  when the global voice is set to WebSpeech. Your current global voice is 
  set to Azure/Google. Non-eligible viewers will have no voice to fall back to.
  
  Recommendation: Change the global voice to WebSpeech in the Voice Settings 
  tab, or switch to "Access to All" mode.
  ```

#### Warning #2: Mode Change Prevention
- Prevents switching to Premium Voice Access mode when global voice is Azure/Google
- Shows temporary warning message: "Cannot enable Premium Voice Access while global voice is set to Azure or Google. Please set global voice to WebSpeech first."

**Files Modified:**
- `src/frontend/screens/tts/tabs/TTSAccessTab.tsx`:
  - Added global validation warning at top of tab
  - Modified `handleModeChange()` to prevent invalid mode switches
  - Removed duplicate warning from Premium Voice Access section

## Pending Investigation

### Issue #5: Moderator Status Not Working
**Problem:** User `eggieberttestacc` was made a mod but TTS still denied with "does not meet Limited Access criteria". Logs show mod wasn't recognized despite sync.

**Status:** Enhanced logging added for debugging

**Logging Added:**
- `checkAccessEligibility()` - Logs all config values and check results
- `checkSubscriptionEligibility()` - Logs subscription data and decisions
- `checkModeratorEligibility()` - Logs moderator status lookup result
- All eligibility checks now log their results

**Debug Steps for User:**
1. Make `eggieberttestacc` a moderator in Twitch
2. In Stream Synth, go to Viewers tab ‚Üí Sync Viewers
3. Go to TTS Access tab ‚Üí Enable "Allow Mod" checkbox
4. Have `eggieberttestacc` send a TTS message
5. Check console logs for output like:
   ```
   [TTSAccessControl] Checking eligibility for viewer 123456 in limited_access mode
   [TTSAccessControl] Config: denyGifted=0, allowVIP=0, allowMod=1, redeemName=null
   [TTSAccessControl] Subscriber check: false
   [TTSAccessControl] isViewerModerator(123456) returned: true
   [TTSAccessControl] Moderator check: true
   ```

**Expected Findings:**
- If `isViewerModerator()` returns `false`: Sync didn't work, moderator not in database
- If `allowMod` is `0`: User forgot to enable "Allow Mod" checkbox in UI
- If moderator check passes but still denied: Issue elsewhere in code flow

**Files Modified for Debugging:**
- `src/backend/services/tts-access-control.ts` - Added comprehensive logging
