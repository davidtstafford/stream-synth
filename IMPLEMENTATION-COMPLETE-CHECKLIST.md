# Implementation Completion Checklist

## ‚úÖ Backend Implementation

### Database Layer
- [x] Created `tts_provider_status` table in migrations
- [x] Table tracks: provider, is_enabled, last_synced_at, voice_count
- [x] Table has proper indexes and foreign keys

### Repository Layer
- [x] Implemented `purgeProvider()` - deletes voices + numeric IDs
- [x] Implemented `assignNumericIds()` - creates sequential 1-N IDs
- [x] Updated `upsertVoice()` - uses natural key (voice_id) as PK
- [x] Updated `getStats()` - returns available count
- [x] Implemented `getProviderStatus()` - checks sync status
- [x] Implemented `updateProviderStatus()` - marks provider as synced
- [x] Removed obsolete methods (reassignNumericIds, deleteVoicesNotInList, markProvider*)

### Service Layer
- [x] Updated `syncWebSpeechVoices()` - purge first, then insert, assign IDs
- [x] Updated `syncAzureVoices()` - same pattern
- [x] Implemented `rescanProviderImmediate()` - entry point for immediate rescan
- [x] Removed `rescanProvider()` - old next-startup approach

### IPC Handlers
- [x] Implemented `provider:rescan-immediate` handler - takes provider + voices
- [x] Handler calls backend service
- [x] Returns success/count/stats for frontend
- [x] Updated `provider:toggle` to use new methods
- [x] Proper error handling in all handlers

### Compilation
- [x] No TypeScript errors in backend
- [x] No compilation warnings
- [x] Webpack build succeeds

- [x] Gets current voices from Web Speech API
- [x] Shows loading spinner while rescanning
- [x] Calls `provider:rescan-immediate` IPC
- [x] Reloads voice list from DB on success
- [x] Shows success/error message
- [x] Proper error handling

### UI Updates
- [x] Rescan button shows loading state

- [x] Tooltip explains functionality
- [x] Success message displays voice count

### Removed/Updated
- [x] Removed old "will rescan on next startup" message
